(0:00) the symbol of the disco era uh Studio 54 was not particularly about politics. Uh and there is this famous uh story that you didn't get in. Recently I had a podcast with Barry Dilla the Hollywood mogul I know >> who had a very similar experience. She also wanted to go to 54, didn't get in. And she described it in a way as a motivator for for him to to get I don't know, not only to get in, but to get

(0:30) even better and show it to the rest of the world. So your story uh led to uh Lefrey, the most famous cheek. >> Can you share that story with us? >> Yeah. So it was um so we had uh the very first song that I wrote, Everybody Dance, was really the hip underground chic record. Yes. Dance, dance, dance ya was on the radio getting a lot of play.

(1:01) Like you said, they played dance dance the floor. Dance floor gets packed. But but what everybody dance was the the symbol of chic coolness. That bass playing that Bernard laid on that was just unbelievable. And that song was actually well known in the underground for about a year before we got a record deal. So, Grace Jones had heard Everybody Dance, and that was like really an important song to her, and she

(1:31) called us and asked us to uh come and see her um because she was thinking about having us be her then record producers, you know, like in it would be, you know, 1977 or something like that. Um Yeah. And we couldn't believe it because we we had never done anything with a star even though all of our singles were hitting.

(2:02) Every every single we put out bang bang bang everything was in the top five every song. So uh by that time we had already had two chic singles that were big. We had our first lead singer, Norma Jean. Her record uh called Saturday was big and we had done Sister Sledge. So we had He's the Greatest Dancer and Now We Are Family. And um even though we

(2:32) recorded that album, at the same time we recorded Chic's second album, uh we had decided to give the song He's the Greatest Dancer to Sister Sledge, which we wrote for ourselves. But when we went to Studio 54 that particular night, now this is the true story. That wasn't the first time we'd ever tried to go to Studio 54. My girlfriend >> Did you get in before? >> Oh, yeah. Many times. But I always had to be with my girlfriend. She used to

(3:02) work at a store called Fioruchi. And so all the people in Fuchi were totally cool and every you know, they all looked stylish and fashionable. So when I was with my girlfriend, I could get in. But that's >> Fiori. >> Pardon me. >> Exactly. Gucci Fiori. >> You know that that's the very first time anybody ever name checked fashion designers on a record. And now I mean we created a formula which we didn't even realize that we were creating. Uh now you can't buy a pop record without them

(3:33) namechecking something. Um because it sort of describes the person's lifestyle. you know, you say you roll, you were Lamborghini rolling or whatever. So anyway, what happened was that night we were really going to do business. So the other times that I had been to Studio 54 with my girlfriend, I was going there to party and the business that I was doing was just taking what they played at Studio 54 compared to what they played at the underground clubs. So now we were going

(4:05) to do business. So we dressed like gentlemen, so to speak, and we did what Grace Jones had told us. So she cold called us cuz we didn't really have any managers. It was just chic organization. And somehow she was able to use her connections to find us. She called us and she spoke in a way that seemed a little odd to us. She says, "So darling, I want you to come to the back door and

(4:36) tell them that your personal friends are misgr." And to us, it sounded like a cross between Bella Losce, Marlene Dietrich, and Bob Marley. We didn't know, we didn't know that that actually was her speaking voice cuz, but we knew the record's tired to get down on you. You know, she had that kind of nasal thing going on. you know, roll up to the bumper, baby, with your long back limo, you know, so we thought Grace Jones would be speaking like that, but instead

(5:06) she had this sort of continental accent and it was odd. And we thought that that's what we were supposed to do, that we were supposed to imitate that very um very sort of distinguish sounding thing. And you know we were she so we go to the back door and we go hello we are personal friends of m Jones the guy looks at us and he slams the door in our faces and but but when he was doing it

(5:36) anyway he goes oh [ __ ] off we no no no we kicking the door saying no this is the truth we cuz this was New Year's Eve right 1977 going into 78 like Studio 54 was the hottest place on the planet everybody was trying to get into Studio 54 on New Year's Eve. So, we kicked the door a lot because we had to be louder than the music inside and to get this guy's attention. And he came back and he said, "Didn't I tell you to [ __ ] off?"

(6:07) Well, Studio 54 was one block away from my apartment at that time. Um, so we walked to my apartment, but before we got to our my apartment, uh, which is where our instruments were, and you know where Bernard and I would write all the songs cuz we had recording studio that we worked at right on the ground floor, but I lived on the top floor. Um, we had to pass a liquor store. We bought two bottles of of Don Peron champagne, what

(6:39) we used to call rock and roll mouthwash. And we we down them like one swig because we were pretty pretty upset because we had our shoes. I was wearing suede shoes that cost a fortune that were now ruined because it was snowing and they put you know they put salt out and the snow the salt had had penetrated my suede shoes. So, so this night we couldn't think of anything except for [ __ ] off. Oh, [ __ ] off. So,

(7:11) we went to my apartment. I picked up my guitar and started playing a little riff. Um, now if you notice that most chic songs, um, and this is before the time, this is before like the current market where where music sort of, um, like in our current world now, music is basically loops, two bar loops, sometimes four bar

(7:41) loops. And for some strange reason reason, my compositions were these sort of loop based compositions. Like it's not that we were loops, but we were actually playing. And so the choruses and the verses are harmonically pretty much the same. I'll just sometimes do a different inversion or we'll dynamically change it, but it's pretty much the same

(8:11) thing. It's just a a revoicing of the chorus, so to speak. So, we went back to the apartment and I started playing a [ __ ] off. Don't [ __ ] studio 54. [ __ ] off. [ __ ] off. and Bernard started going and we singing and we wrote a whole song where the uh we did verses and middle

(8:44) and the whole bit and we wrote a song where the most appropriate response would be [ __ ] off. So we would say like if a cab driver cuts you off, [ __ ] off if your mom asks you to do homework, [ __ ] off. It was great and we were laughing. We were totally entertained. And Bernard said, "Uh, my man, cuz he we always wore dark glasses." Said, "My man, you know this [ __ ] is happening." I was like, "Bernard, this is like two

(9:14) years before hip-hop. We like we're not going to get [ __ ] off on the radio." But I was I grew up as a hippie. Like my parents would beat Nicks. I was a hippie. Um, so I said to him and like my whole demeanor changed. I went from being like the cool club kid in the nice suit to like, oh man, like you know, you know, when you drop acid, man, cuz now you were saying, "Oh, [ __ ] off." And we

(9:44) knew a good euphemism for [ __ ] in America is free. Oh, you freaking nuts. You freaking maniac. Oh, freak. Get the freak out of here. Um, so I said, "Oh, man. You know, like when you drop acid and you have a bad trip, uh, it's like freaking out, man." And Bernard was like, "He came from a completely different background." And he looked at me like I was crazy. And so right away, I got my black union card back. I said, "Well, you know, like if you see a fine girl and you go out on the dance floor and you just start freaking out," and he

(10:15) says, "Oh, man." And it's like that new dance my kids are doing. What new dance her kids are doing? The Freak. Really? Oh, wow. There's a dance called The Freak. Yeah. So, we ran out to the record store and we got the uh what we thought would be the uh I guess the template for a great record about a dance. Chubby Checker, the Twist. Like, what's

(10:45) more iconic than that? like maybe one of the biggest songs about a specific dance ever. So we buy that and then we buy Joey D and the Starlighter song called The Peppermint Twist and we listen to the record and Chubby Checker goes, "Come on baby, let's do the twist. Come on baby, let's do the twist. Take me by the middle bop and go like this."

(11:16) We're like waiting for him to tell us how to do the twist and we realize he doesn't tell us. Joey D and the Starlighters. Well, we got a new dance and it goes like this. Well, the name of this dance is the peppermint twist. The peppermint twist. Oh, all right. All right. They don't say how to do them peppermint twist. We go, what the hell? We don't know how to do the freak. So, we just say, "Have you heard about the new dance craze list now? I'm sure

(11:47) you'll be amazed. Big fun to be had by everyone. It's up to you. Surely can be done. Young and old are doing this, I'm told. Just one try and you two will be sold. It's called the freak. They're doing it night and day. Allow us. We'll show you the way." And of course, we can't show you the way cuz we don't know how to do it. So, we just go, "Ah, freak out. A [ __ ] off. A freak out." Unbelievable story. >> Biggest selling record in the history of Atlante. Now we're talking the record that has um everybody from Ray Charles,

(12:18) Artha Franklin to Cream, the Rolling Stones, biggest record. Um uh Crosby, Stills and Nash, um I mean just all these huge superstars. But the biggest selling single of all times is a freak out of a frustration after you didn't get inu to studio. Wonderful.
