1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:08,000
2018 2019 in fintech was late spring.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,920
You get into 2020 and COVID and that was

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,679
utter insanity of a of a story.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,880
>> Like 25% of all venture dollars in that

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,920
period went into fintech which is

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,440
>> Wow. 25%.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,279
>> The stat after that is not a good stat

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,520
which is um starting in like the second

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,960
half of 2022 like basically 0% of

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,760
venture dollars went into

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,359
>> drought maybe.

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,039
>> Yeah. Yeah. Fintech winter was the

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,640
second half of 2022. Most of 23 and 24

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,320
things started to thaw a little bit and

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,000
like now we're very much back in spring.

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,920
It turns out the biggest use case for AI

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,360
is fraudsters committing fraud against

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,520
financial services companies. Financial

19
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,520
fraud is growing at like like 18 to 20%

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,440
a year uh which is insane and it's

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,920
already a huge market. I mean the cattle

22
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,079
win long term, but the mouse is winning

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,079
right now.

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,480
Zach, David, uh, we did this podcast, I

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,000
believe, seven years ago, and it's great

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,039
to have the the gang back together.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,920
Thanks for joining.

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,600
>> Thank you for having us.

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,199
>> Great to be here. Of course, a lot has

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,559
happened since the last conversation in

31
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,240
our personal lives, and a lot has

32
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,840
happened in in fintech more broadly. I

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,720
was listening to the the episode that we

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,560
did um the last time we spoke and we

35
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,799
were talking about what has changed in

36
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,960
fintech, you know, from early 2010s to

37
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,520
to just before 2020. And I'm curious if

38
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,240
we could just sort of um check in or

39
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,360
reflect back as to, you know, since the

40
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,280
last time we spoke to to to now, what

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,000
have been some of the major themes in in

42
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,759
in fintech? C catch us uh catch us up if

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,200
someone was in a coma after listening to

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,600
the last episode and just woke up and

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,000
said, "Hey, what's changed in in

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,439
fintech?" What would we say?

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,920
>> Let's see. So, the last last time we

48
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,159
talked was probably 2018 2019. Is that

49
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,640
right?

50
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,079
>> Yes.

51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,000
>> Yeah. So, let's see. um a a lot. There's

52
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,520
been like a bunch of different eras or

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,159
like maybe we can think of it as like

54
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:57,600
almost seasons in some sense. Um 2018

55
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,320
2019 in fintech was I guess like kind of

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,000
late late spring. Um lot of lot of

57
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,600
really good growth like the industry had

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,960
a name. The name probably came about I

59
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,880
actually think that David you created a

60
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,840
name but no one will give you credit but

61
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,479
I will give you credit. I think you

62
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,319
created the name in like 2015. Um but we

63
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,160
we we now had a name for this industry.

64
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,280
We had gone past like oh some people are

65
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,280
maybe building financial services

66
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,400
products to um all right we like it is

67
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,720
an industry and there are a lot of

68
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,480
things being built. Um you know we

69
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,319
started to see the the million flowers

70
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,480
bloom to to really overextend this

71
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,520
analogy the million flowers bloom bloom

72
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:34,319
from call it like 2014 2015 up until

73
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,840
2019 2020 like zillions of uh first time

74
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,200
hey can I take this thing outside of a

75
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,280
physical bank branch and deliver it to a

76
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,879
consumer digitally. Um so you saw

77
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,480
applications like Robin Hood come up and

78
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,720
grow incredibly well. you see all sorts

79
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,160
of neo bank neo bankank for x or y or z

80
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,319
subm market. Uh those are everywhere. Um

81
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,400
uh you saw crypto like the first crypto

82
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,160
apps really start to emerge and and grow

83
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,440
a lot. Um and then kind of from 2019 you

84
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,560
get into like 2020 and COVID and that

85
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,840
was kind of just utter insanity of a of

86
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,640
a story. Um you know first the first few

87
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,319
months of 2020 were totally normal. Uh

88
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,720
then you get into early COVID where

89
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,360
everything froze. Um basically every

90
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,480
business um kind of locked up including

91
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,720
all the fintech companies. Um but within

92
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,080
you know two two and a half months you

93
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,840
then had this total inversion of

94
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,640
fintech. So you went from late spring to

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,640
like big EDM pumping uh summer uh really

96
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,239
fast like the EDM music turned on very

97
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,840
loudly very quickly. Um and uh so you

98
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,080
just had this insane growth period for

99
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:41,120
fintech uh from kind of mid 2020 through

100
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,519
um kind of like the end of 2021 and even

101
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,920
into early 2022. And yes, a lot of new

102
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:49,599
companies formed, but um every investor,

103
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,879
whether venture or public markets or

104
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,799
whatever it was, wanted to push money

105
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,319
into fintech. Um and so you had just

106
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,080
this this huge boom in funding, tons of

107
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,599
new stuff grew. It was it was like

108
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,439
really fun and very chaotic time

109
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,040
honestly like a hard time to manage

110
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,480
because uh you know the feature chase

111
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,799
the things we had to build were going so

112
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,400
rapidly.

113
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,680
>> I think like 25% of all venture dollars

114
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,720
in that period went into fintech which

115
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,000
is insane.

116
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,120
>> 25%.

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,959
>> It's a crazy stat actually. I think it's

118
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,040
a great stat. The stat after that is not

119
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,879
a good stat which is um starting in like

120
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,040
the second half of 2022 like basically

121
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,840
0% of venture dollars went into

122
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,519
>> drought maybe.

123
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,600
>> Yeah. Yeah. So um summer uh went into a

124
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,600
very very short fall. So that was kind

125
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,199
of like mid 2022 and then immediately

126
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,440
into winter. Um and fintech winter was

127
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,479
the second half of 2022.

128
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,000
Most of 23 and 24 things started to thaw

129
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,360
a little bit and like now we're very

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,960
much back into spring. Yep.

131
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,440
>> Um different format, but it's been it's

132
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,199
been a fun cycle of the seasons.

133
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,720
Totally. I you know and I think even to

134
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,960
describe maybe what drove some of the

135
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,120
seasons like you know the the rate cycle

136
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,759
was a big part of that as like a from

137
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,199
like a macro perspective you know having

138
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,120
very low rates you know kind of drove

139
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,199
Zer obviously not unique to fintech but

140
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,639
a lot of you know technology broadly but

141
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,280
certainly a lot of lending volume in the

142
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,039
space grew massively in those periods um

143
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,800
you know the one benefit that I think

144
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,800
has shown up more recently in fintech

145
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,800
you know in the in the thaw period is

146
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,560
that rates went up and it it it sort of

147
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,479
shifted the mix of revenues for for any

148
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,240
of these fintech companies from lending

149
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,120
driven kind of origination you know

150
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,320
oriented stuff to you know deposits um

151
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,639
you know so many of these fintech

152
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,960
companies decided I forget the exact

153
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,039
timing but to go kind of full stack you

154
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,440
know so you saw you know uh fintech

155
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,280
companies like SoFi you know buy banks

156
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,919
you know lending club uh I think square

157
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,440
got an ILC charter um you know Robin

158
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,039
Hood Mercury many of these companies are

159
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,240
generating very significant percentages

160
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,240
of their revenue and profits today from

161
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,400
deposit flows as rates have gone up And

162
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,680
so that I think has helped thaw the

163
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,160
market you know to some degree more

164
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,759
recently

165
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,199
>> usually. Yeah. And in in in 20 um 2018

166
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,680
2019 um fintech was a startup industry

167
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,479
um having gone through this entire cycle

168
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,759
um yeah some ups some downs um but a lot

169
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,560
of maturation um a lot of expansion.

170
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,000
We've ended now with fintech is in my

171
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,880
opinion synonymous with financial

172
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,080
services.

173
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,600
>> Um and it goes beyond just financial

174
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,080
services as well. So you you've seen a

175
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,400
few themes emerge. Um one thing that

176
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,919
that uh we said for a long time that

177
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,520
Andre Horus also likes to say is that

178
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,520
every company is a fintech company and

179
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:29,440
that was kind of quite common from 2018

180
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,680
um kind of onward. Um now you see the

181
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,000
emergence of embedded finance. So you

182
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,759
know some apply customers are like Ford

183
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,319
and John Deere and these companies that

184
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,759
like you know yes they do have captive

185
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,039
financial services uh embedded within

186
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,280
them but you do not think of them as

187
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,919
financial services companies um or you

188
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,560
know large billers or it's expanded

189
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,520
quite a lot. Um and then you see the

190
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,960
banks themselves saying um historically

191
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,400
they said oh we need to be fintech

192
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,840
companies too. Now they're saying we are

193
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,400
the biggest fintech companies like we

194
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,080
invest heavily in technology. And so

195
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,800
you've seen the startup industry now

196
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,880
become mainstream and the firmament of

197
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,400
financial services but also powering

198
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,120
experiences well beyond financial

199
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,960
services.

200
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,840
>> Let's go deeper into where we are today

201
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,919
and and and and where we're going um g

202
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,039
given that we're kind of in a you know

203
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,199
exciting period. um you is it still like

204
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,000
macro in terms like is it still early in

205
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,360
terms of lot of things to be built um

206
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,120
and some of the spaces you're you're

207
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,120
excited about when maybe Zach you take

208
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,319
the first plaid ourselves have have gone

209
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,960
through a few phases and we're lucky

210
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,479
that we have this really broad view of

211
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,840
what's what's happening in fintech I'm

212
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,520
going to keep calling it fintech but at

213
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,479
this point realize that I mean financial

214
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,360
services plus+ um so we have this really

215
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:46,720
broad view of what's going on in fintech

216
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,280
um and like the the things that we're

217
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,280
seeing today are, you know, very

218
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,720
different and much more varied than um

219
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,479
they were before. So um V1 of Plaid was

220
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,800
how do we create access for everyone?

221
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,080
And I would say largely um the fintech

222
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,080
industry was focused on the same thing.

223
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,440
So um instead of making you walk into a

224
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,960
bank branch to open a bank account, how

225
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,360
can you open a bank account on your

226
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,919
mobile app? um instead of um you know

227
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,039
making you carry money um and go to an

228
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,960
exchange when you're trying to cross a

229
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,479
border, how can we create a digital way

230
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,319
to do remittances so you can actually

231
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,479
move money across the border um a little

232
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,800
bit more easily. Um and and and apply

233
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,479
that across kind of every every subse

234
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,720
basically every product uh that that the

235
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,960
banks were building at the time. Um

236
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,520
we've solved the access problem not

237
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,440
completely not in every little niche but

238
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,719
but for the most part we as a collective

239
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,120
industry have solved the access problem.

240
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,640
So, um, you know, I grew up in a small

241
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,800
small town, uh, you know, only one bank

242
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,320
in our town. Um, and if you didn't

243
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,360
happen to be a member of that bank, you

244
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,880
you couldn't get a loan easily. Um, now

245
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,160
if you live in that same town, you just

246
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,600
go online and you apply for a mortgage

247
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,360
and you get, you know, 30 mortgage

248
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,120
offers in an hour. Um, or you can do it

249
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,120
with Rocket and, you know, be done in 5

250
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,519
minutes. And, um, these are awesome

251
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,720
experiences. That said, what we've done

252
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,399
is we've taken traditional financial

253
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,480
services and we've made it digital. We

254
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,240
haven't necessarily made it excellent.

255
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,680
Um that's that's like the next horizon

256
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,680
for us. And so a lot of things that

257
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,800
we've been investing in now are things

258
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,160
like credit scoring. How do we make

259
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,200
credit scoring more logical and

260
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,440
something that a consumer can

261
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,200
understand? Um if you get a new job and

262
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,800
your income goes up but your expenses

263
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,399
don't go up, you were a better loan

264
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,399
risk. However, that doesn't show up in

265
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,080
your credit file for like many many

266
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,640
years because your credit file is long

267
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,399
history of your your your repayments. Um

268
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,519
it's not necessarily indicative of your

269
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,120
your free cash flow. Um and so like that

270
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,800
that is the next horizon that a lot of

271
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,720
the fintech companies that I'm seeing

272
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,399
are starting to solve. So that's that's

273
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,839
kind of like one big area. It's it's um

274
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,680
kind of solving those endemic problems

275
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,600
that are longlasting things like like

276
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,800
fraud, things like credit scoring, so on

277
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,880
and so forth. Um the second is um you

278
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,320
know making financial services really

279
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,920
easily available in places that you

280
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,480
might not have otherwise thought it to

281
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,519
be. Um so you know putting BNPL on kind

282
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,680
of everything.

283
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,600
>> Yeah. um uh or or you know issuing a

284
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,320
card kind of everywhere or issuing a

285
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,760
wallet kind of everywhere. Um and so now

286
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,519
now we're we're entering this like

287
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,720
fintech is everywhere. Not every company

288
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,320
is a fintech company but like every

289
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,760
every consumer is surrounded by fintech

290
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,640
and in in all the places they might want

291
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,720
to go. Um and like you know the the

292
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,399
future horizons are always like you know

293
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,480
looking at the the next few things that

294
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,320
are happening like we look at AI and

295
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,760
Agentic Financial Services and right now

296
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,959
it's mostly hype and people talking

297
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,040
about it and there are a few interesting

298
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,560
use cases but you know fast forward two

299
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,399
years and the way that you get a

300
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,920
mortgage is going to be talking to you

301
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,360
an AI application um because that is

302
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,640
just the most efficient fastest way to

303
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,680
do it. So that's that's been a

304
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,279
fascinating one to watch and then like

305
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,200
seeing what's going on with stables is

306
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,880
of course fascinating as well. So, um,

307
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,959
lots more to come.

308
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,279
>> Just on that note, it is crypto

309
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,360
basically just fintech or, you know,

310
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,720
people said is the new version of the

311
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,320
internet. Maybe hopefully it still

312
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,560
happens, but in terms of where it is

313
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,800
right now, is it, you know, mo mostly

314
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,560
just a subset of fintech?

315
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,920
>> Well, David, you're an investor, so you

316
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,600
probably know better than me. My my take

317
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,640
is

318
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,560
sometimes like ultimately I don't think

319
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,640
that consumers

320
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,560
um change all that much over time and so

321
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,120
the kind of things that a consumer would

322
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,640
want to do 5 years ago are similar to

323
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,800
the kinds of things that they might want

324
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,320
to do today but the form factor in which

325
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,120
they can do it uh is very different. So

326
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,440
um you know 5 years ago um a consumer

327
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,640
might want to speculate um and you know

328
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,000
you can speculate on gold, you can

329
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,079
speculate on a few of these other things

330
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,519
and u bitcoin and and and other uh coins

331
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,040
made it very simple for consumers to

332
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,480
speculate. So great you can pull up an

333
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,320
app, you can speculate on things,

334
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,240
speculation continues. Um the form

335
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,399
factor has changed. Um another thing

336
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,399
that consumers like to do is make

337
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,320
predictions. Um so you know in the past

338
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,800
you might make a bet with some friends.

339
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,959
Um uh now you might go on Cal Street or

340
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,079
Poly Market and uh you know enter

341
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,399
prediction markets or you might do that

342
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,760
via Robin Hood or or whatever it is. Um

343
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,760
other things that consumers like to do

344
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,000
are like you know spend money, save,

345
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,760
invest so and so forth. And in as much

346
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,519
as consumer behavior doesn't change it's

347
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,200
a question of like how and where does

348
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,800
crypto and fintech fit into the existing

349
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,480
set of consumer behaviors.

350
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,000
>> So I think if you look at again what a

351
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,839
bank does like they're roughly tailored

352
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
to what consumers want. Consumers want

353
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,720
to save money, invest, get loans so and

354
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,079
so forth. Um and I think the wisest

355
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,079
product development strategy is to kind

356
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,360
of like take um take the things that

357
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,800
consumers already do and just like make

358
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,560
them newer, easier, more accessible, so

359
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,760
on and so forth. Um and so I suspect

360
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,959
that there will be a convergence of uh

361
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:34,160
one side of crypto um and core financial

362
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,079
services um be that exchanging um you

363
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,839
know like checking accounts with dollars

364
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:41,279
in them for checking accounts with USDC

365
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,360
in them wallets with USDC in them um or

366
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,200
or or similar like I think there's a a

367
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,120
convergence that'll likely happen there

368
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,320
but then also crypto does some crazy out

369
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,519
there stuff and really pushes the bounce

370
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,720
on innovation and like totally

371
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,320
>> I'm not sure that that's necessarily

372
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,880
going to end up merging with banks but

373
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,800
who knows

374
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,240
>> totally. Yeah. Yeah. I I mean I totally

375
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,639
agree with with what what Zach was

376
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,800
saying. I think part of it is um you

377
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,880
know culture, right? And how people to

378
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,920
Zach's point, you know, um you know,

379
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,200
want to interact with financial

380
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,200
services. I think part of this has been

381
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,200
driven from a regulatory perspective.

382
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,560
And I think maybe the more meta theme as

383
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,480
I've sort of watched fintech evolve and

384
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,240
I think this is permeating into crypto

385
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,839
is just how the large incumbent

386
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,360
financial institutions are are embracing

387
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,120
this innovation and technology, you

388
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,560
know, at large. I think a lot of the you

389
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,680
know I'd refer to my you know crypto

390
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,000
colleagues who are much deeper in this

391
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,880
space than I am. A lot of the enthusiasm

392
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,320
I I would say here is about uh you know

393
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,839
the existing kind of financial system

394
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,000
adopting you know things like stable

395
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,040
coins or maybe even tokenizing kind of

396
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,800
real world world assets and um I think

397
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,240
that's that's different in you know from

398
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,760
a lot of the more frontier stuff that

399
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,760
that I think the team had had talked

400
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,360
about internally which was kind of more

401
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,120
purely decentralized and and kind of

402
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,800
owning the internet but but I think you

403
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,079
know for crypto to go very mainstream

404
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,320
and kind of plug into the broader

405
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,000
financial system that probably is and

406
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,160
will continue to happen with with Zach

407
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,920
and the team PL have done you know over

408
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,839
you know the last 14 years 13 years uh

409
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,360
is is remarkable. I mean you know you

410
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,320
you know from my vantage point like you

411
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,160
won the hearts and minds of the

412
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,920
developer community. You built this sort

413
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,199
of foundational infrastructure that

414
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,800
really catalyzed like you know I I can't

415
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,040
take credit for creating the fintech uh

416
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,160
term. You like created the enabling

417
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,480
infrastructure to like create the

418
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,600
industry in many ways. um you know now

419
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,920
have I don't know hundreds of millions

420
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,680
of accounts you know connected and and

421
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,680
you're to your point now bringing kind

422
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,760
of this whole ecosystem of kind of value

423
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,560
added services and analytics you know to

424
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,000
make financial products better um and I

425
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,720
think while we saw different seasons

426
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,199
kind of over that period you know uh you

427
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,480
know hay fever and and long winters and

428
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:40,959
uh uh you know euphoria in some moments

429
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,560
um you know many of these companies are

430
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,600
now bigger than ever I mean Robin Hood

431
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,839
is now I don't know hundred billion

432
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,160
dollar public company you I I looked up

433
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,000
SoFi's stock price. You know, they're a

434
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,680
$35 billion public company. A firm is a

435
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,040
$20 billion company. Like these are

436
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,079
these are outcomes that you couldn't

437
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,639
even imagine.

438
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,720
>> Revolute.

439
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,440
>> Yeah. I mean, Revolute $75 billion, you

440
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,120
know, for new investors. And and that

441
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,480
phenomenon is not just US- ccentric to

442
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,720
that point. It's it's become a global

443
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,920
one. I mean, new bank, you know, hundred

444
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,720
billion dollar, you know, you know,

445
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,639
company, you know, in Brazil, you know,

446
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,079
my good friend Pier Paulo who runs WAN

447
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,720
in Argentina, you know, Colombia,

448
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,160
Mexico. um you know so these these

449
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,639
companies have worked and they've kind

450
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,199
of proliferated and brought access of

451
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,600
financial products you know everywhere

452
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,279
um uh and I think that that trend will

453
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,920
continue you know I think while they

454
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,199
started often with point solutions and

455
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,279
they kind of perfected whatever their

456
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,199
wedge product was you know many of them

457
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,800
have now rebundled right they want to

458
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,320
become kind of the full you know

459
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,600
financial picture for their for their

460
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,920
customers whether that's through cards

461
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,360
or accounts or lending um again many of

462
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,000
them have gone full stack and actually

463
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,240
bought banks and actually hold deposits

464
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,120
and are generating significant revenue

465
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,720
you know from from that float.

466
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,000
I think the other meta theme which has

467
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,560
been um been interesting and and I think

468
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,880
it's accelerating now with AI is just

469
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,560
again the um the posture of a lot of the

470
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,959
incumbent financial institutions you

471
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,560
know to fintech and technology broadly.

472
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,440
Um, you know, I saw this kind of

473
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,680
firsthand, uh, certainly, you know, as

474
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,759
an investor back at Spark, as a founder,

475
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,160
and then inside of Goldman, just even

476
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,920
their own sort of evolution, uh, and and

477
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,519
posture to technology, you know, for a

478
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,120
long time, many of these institutions,

479
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,880
like if the technology wasn't built

480
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,639
there, they weren't interested. I mean,

481
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,720
Goldman had literally created their own

482
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,079
email client. Like they they they didn't

483
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,279
operate on Outlook or on Gmail. They had

484
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,399
this thing called Orbit. I don't know

485
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,560
why Goldman Sachs needs to create their

486
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,320
own email client, but you know that that

487
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,360
was that was like a window into the

488
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,759
psychology from a technology

489
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,040
perspective.

490
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,480
>> Don't they still use like secd

491
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,440
internally like they they have their own

492
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,959
database that they built?

493
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,399
>> That that makes more sense to me because

494
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,320
it was like a centralized risk system

495
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,959
for managing all their trades but

496
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,959
outlook equivalent like makes no sense.

497
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,519
Um you know then I think there was this

498
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,959
period where you know many of the large

499
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,639
institutions were like we want to be the

500
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,120
fintech companies ourselves and you know

501
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,920
Goldman went very aggressively and you

502
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,399
know into Marcus and and others followed

503
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,160
suit. I think there's a bit of a

504
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,280
humbling that has happened. You know,

505
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,679
may maybe I'm using them as one one

506
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,919
lens, but but more broadly, I think the

507
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,679
the positive impact of that experience

508
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,679
um made them more open to adopting the

509
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,000
best technology that exists in the

510
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,319
market and and no longer are building

511
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,480
everything in house. And so a lot of

512
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:26,319
where I've been spending time the past

513
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,600
several years has been in, you know,

514
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,080
fintech companies that lead with

515
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,080
software that, you know, ideally have

516
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,919
the potential for a network effect and

517
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,440
are selling into these financial, you

518
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,440
know, larger financial institutions and

519
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,320
solving, you know, real real workflow

520
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,640
challenges for them. Um, and I think

521
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,320
we're at this interesting moment where

522
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,039
because the software itself can actually

523
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,960
do the work, you know, with AI, there's

524
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,240
sort of this bottoms up momentum and top

525
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,600
down pressure that's happening that I

526
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,360
think is accelerating this cultural

527
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,440
change. you know, many of these

528
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,360
institutions are beginning to adopt

529
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,000
products like cursor or, you know, even

530
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,000
GitHub copilot or a broader ecosystem of

531
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,360
kind of AI products in their in their

532
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,760
employee base and people are seeing the

533
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,360
productivity gains and then unlike I

534
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,320
think prior periods of of kind of

535
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,840
product cycle or platform shifts, if you

536
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,000
were the CEO of a big bank and you said,

537
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,640
you know, do I need to be in the cloud?

538
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,200
Like that was sort of an esoteric

539
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,720
question. Now it's like any CEO, any

540
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,160
board member can plug a prompt into one

541
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,280
of these models and sort of intuitively

542
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,360
understand the impact that it could have

543
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,799
on their business. And so I think that's

544
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,880
broadening the aperture at least from my

545
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,320
vantage point of what fintech is.

546
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,320
>> And it's really I think to your point

547
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,600
just financial services and I think

548
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,960
software in large part sold into

549
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,520
financial services as well.

550
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,799
>> Yeah. And and and David say more about

551
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:44,080
sort of that that change around when you

552
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,000
know it went from 25% to you know

553
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,520
significantly less than that. what what

554
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,760
was changing in these businesses that

555
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,200
that that caused that you you mentioned

556
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,400
sort of the macro environment. Is there

557
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,480
anything else we could learn from it and

558
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,200
and more around now where are you

559
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,360
particularly excited to to to invest or

560
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,520
what what are the sort of different um

561
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,360
you know sort of subspaces that you're

562
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,400
you know looking at or excited to

563
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,480
>> I think 2021 period was sort of wild for

564
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,200
lots of reasons. I think um you know

565
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,480
financial services is and remains

566
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,120
obviously one of the biggest parts of

567
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,120
our global economy and so I think people

568
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,280
you know often get over excited maybe by

569
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,520
TAM you know and and and so every

570
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,120
venture firm created a fintech team had

571
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,400
you know was deploying a lot of capital

572
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,760
you know to that market um uh you know

573
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,840
and again many of these companies have

574
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,400
have continued to succeed but I think it

575
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,000
it was probably um too much euphoria

576
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,960
going into that space relative to the

577
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,320
amount of dollars um

578
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,600
>> no I think it was the exact right amount

579
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,679
of euphoria Yeah, just the pullback

580
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,480
afterwards that was the issue.

581
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,880
>> Uh exact exactly you know again part of

582
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,400
that was that companies you know when

583
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,000
rates are zero you can lend money and

584
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,520
and grow very quickly and there's a lot

585
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,720
of you know margin to capture there. I

586
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,240
think when rates go up your cost of

587
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,799
capital goes up and that margin you know

588
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,640
shrinks and there's a natural ceiling on

589
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,240
on borrowing that people you know both

590
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,840
from a regulatory perspective and a and

591
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,600
a kind of consumer appetite perspective.

592
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,440
So you know the business model of a lot

593
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,640
of on the lending side I think you know

594
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,000
kind of compressed

595
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,520
>> but you also have to look at like the

596
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,320
underlying growth rates of these apps

597
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,720
were insane.

598
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,720
>> Totally.

599
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,640
>> Like you you you look at the number of

600
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,039
consumers that were you know signing up

601
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,960
to invest or signing up to take a loan

602
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,600
or signing up to buy Bitcoin or whatever

603
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,440
it was. Totally

604
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,520
>> like we just looked at the the charts

605
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,240
and like you know if if the app was

606
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,760
growing at what 25% a month it was

607
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,960
actually a great venture investment. I

608
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,320
mean, yes, you might know that the music

609
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,880
at some point is going to slow down or

610
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,360
stop, but um 25% a month's growth is

611
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,559
insane.

612
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,320
>> Totally.

613
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,000
>> Yeah, totally. I mean, yeah. And this

614
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,799
was like stimulus and there was there

615
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,640
was a lot of

616
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,679
>> helicopter money everywhere. Yeah. There

617
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,280
were a lot of reasons they were growing

618
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,159
that fast.

619
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,520
>> 100%. And look, I think like from a I

620
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,039
don't know industry health perspective,

621
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,640
like I think things have normalized, but

622
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,080
the the companies continue to grow and

623
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,679
succeed. I mean, again, now they're, you

624
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,679
know, bigger than they've ever been. the

625
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,320
the great ones. There was a wash out and

626
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,720
and um there were a lot of fintech

627
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,480
companies that um died or shut down in

628
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,760
the second half of 22 in the first half

629
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,559
of 23. Um there were a lot that you know

630
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,200
kind of went sideways for uh for quite a

631
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,640
while. Um and a lot of lenders

632
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,400
especially who just like basically

633
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,880
closed up shop or merge or things like

634
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,559
that.

635
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,640
>> Um but the ones that succeeded coming

636
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,240
out of it across all of fintech they

637
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,400
were much much stronger for it. Totally.

638
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,480
So, as you said, like if you started off

639
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,919
with a neo bank and all they did was

640
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,159
have a a checking account and a savings

641
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,360
account and maybe a card. Um, well, in

642
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,520
this period, if they wanted to survive,

643
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,919
they needed to to to build the lending

644
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,280
side of of their offering. And so, um,

645
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,240
you know, they they expanded there or

646
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
build the investment side of their

647
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,400
offering, so they expanded there. And

648
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,720
so, now you've come out with these like

649
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,880
much more full-fledged like longlasting

650
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,760
uh companies. So, the winners became

651
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,360
even more so the winners. Um, and yeah,

652
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,720
there was an unfortunate number of

653
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,880
companies that also didn't make it

654
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,120
>> totally. And and David, I'm curious h

655
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,880
how you or how we look at the sort of

656
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,960
investible universe or or sort of

657
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,200
divide. Is it you know that there's

658
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,640
certain type of form factors and it's

659
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,559
you know each region is going to have

660
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,760
their their their new banks so to speak

661
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:06,720
or is it um you know by sort of sort of

662
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,120
form factor or value prop to to the how

663
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,320
do we think about the the universe? How

664
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,679
do we map it?

665
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,120
>> You know it's been interesting. I mean,

666
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,520
I would say from our from our vantage

667
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,760
point, we haven't made as many consumer

668
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,000
fintech investments in recent years as

669
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,600
we have historically. I think um part of

670
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,280
that's just it's it's more expensive to

671
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,039
acquire customers and and hit the kind

672
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,559
of scale you need to really be, you

673
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,159
know, kind of venture venture scale

674
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,720
outcomes. And I think that's a function

675
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,240
of, you know, um just, you know,

676
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,760
consumer acquisition channels getting

677
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,880
more expensive and some of these

678
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,200
companies starting early and it was

679
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,960
easier to acquire u and then build

680
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,280
massive LTV with their existing customer

681
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,600
bases. that that does change around the

682
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,120
world. I think um you know in some

683
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,720
markets people were entering the formal

684
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,200
financial economy for the first time and

685
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,280
so offering a fee free mobile first you

686
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,039
know bank account and a and a debit card

687
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,799
you know literally gave them access to

688
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,200
you know e-commerce and and things like

689
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,880
Netflix and Spotify and and Amazon for

690
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,880
the you know for the very first time.

691
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,960
Credit doesn't exist you know equally in

692
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,440
in every market around the world nor do

693
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,960
credit bureaus and credit data. Um, so

694
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,559
there's, I think, still, you know, tons

695
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,159
of interesting kind of macro opportunity

696
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,120
from a financial product perspective. I

697
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,039
think especially in emerging economies.

698
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,480
Um, I think AI could be an interesting,

699
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,799
you know, kind of catalyst for a new

700
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,159
resurgence of consumer fintech. I mean,

701
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,400
there there's always been this promise

702
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,200
of, you know, kind of self-driving money

703
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,120
or, um, you know, PFMs that actually do

704
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,640
the work for you and help you make, you

705
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,200
know, not not just give you advice, but

706
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,000
actually, you know, help you earn, you

707
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,640
know, save and and spend better. And I

708
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,840
think like we've yet to see as many of

709
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,159
those companies today, but I think

710
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,520
there's the technology might be ripe.

711
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,919
I'm curious if you're seeing this, you

712
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,280
know, uh on your side like to actually

713
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,760
deliver on that promise.

714
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,000
>> Yeah. You know, it's funny when when we

715
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,520
think about pro prospective apps that

716
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,360
like, you know, the app that I wish that

717
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,559
existed. Um, you know, I wish that there

718
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,440
was a self-driving money app that I

719
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,440
could just say, hey, you know, my

720
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,960
paycheck goes in here. Like, you know,

721
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,400
sweep enough money into my checking

722
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,000
account so that I can pay my daily

723
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,760
expenses, but put all the rest into this

724
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,280
like high yield savings account and you

725
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,679
invest this percent of it in the market.

726
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,360
And, you know, I wish that this thing

727
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,279
existed.

728
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,679
>> I don't actually know that that's

729
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,919
necessarily a very good app to build

730
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,640
because I'm a weird power user. I have

731
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,039
insane trust in fintech companies to do

732
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,559
all this stuff for me. Like I understand

733
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,960
all the actions that the agent would

734
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,240
take and I have uh you know enough

735
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,159
background in the space that like the

736
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,559
actions seem logical to me. But if I

737
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,919
gave that to my mom, she'd be like

738
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,120
where's my body? What's going on? Like I

739
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,320
don't trust this thing. Like wait, why

740
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,600
did it move body over there? I have all

741
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,880
these questions. And so um you know I

742
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,400
I'm not sure that I'm necessarily the

743
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,480
best this like so I I have all these

744
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,480
visions of like the the the prospective

745
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,960
apps that should exist out there. But

746
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,960
then you know for us as plaid and and

747
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,600
and in a lot of senses for for you as an

748
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,960
investor um like certainly for us as

749
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,400
plaid like our job is like we need to

750
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,080
build the platform and then figure out

751
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,840
what emergent behavior starts to exist

752
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,320
on it and then go optimize for that

753
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,840
emerging behavior as uh as as as new

754
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,960
interesting companies start to emerge.

755
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,679
Um and so that's how we think of our

756
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,000
job. So like our job as it relates to AI

757
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,039
is like let's build tools that allow

758
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,679
consumers safely to link their data with

759
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,600
agents. Um then let's build tools that

760
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,679
allow those agents to take the proper

761
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,880
actions. Be that just analyzing data or

762
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,400
be that actually moving money or

763
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,159
something else. Let's let's build tools

764
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,480
that allow those agents to to to to take

765
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,320
those actions. Um and then let's see

766
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,520
what happens and like have a team that's

767
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,200
just like constantly looking at like the

768
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,080
emerging behavior and figuring out oh is

769
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,919
that a good thing? Do we want to

770
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,600
optimize for that? Oh, like has that

771
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,440
enabled some new vector of risk that we

772
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,760
need to we need to avoid? And that's

773
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,960
kind of the the the thought process we

774
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,720
take across all the things that we do.

775
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,000
So, um a lot of it is like if you build

776
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,600
it, they will come. You just don't know

777
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,679
who will come and what they'll look like

778
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,200
and like what exactly is going to be the

779
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,880
next big thing. Um but we have to be

780
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,960
very prepared to react when we see it.

781
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,520
>> Yeah. And I I think as a result like

782
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,919
we've we've been focused on maybe more

783
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,840
known problems like there's so many

784
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,799
there's so much work that happens inside

785
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,559
of all these large financial

786
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,799
institutions that it's just done

787
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,039
manually by expensive people you know

788
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,799
frankly across risk compliance legal you

789
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,400
know vendor onboarding treasury

790
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,480
management I mean you know I can go on

791
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:16,320
and on and on um and and now you have

792
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,559
again AI to actually you know solve many

793
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,080
of those problems and so that's I think

794
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,440
you know largely where we've been

795
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,279
spending time you know, you know,

796
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,480
companies like, you know, moment that

797
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,159
had built, you know, fixed income

798
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,000
trading infrastructure. If you're a

799
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,919
wealth management client of of JP Morgan

800
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,279
today, you know, building a bond ladder

801
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,799
is still a manual process. You're

802
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,919
picking, you know, individual securities

803
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,440
one by one. That's insane. Like that

804
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,000
hasn't existed for, you know, at least a

805
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,600
decade in in equities. And so, you know,

806
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,960
there's a ton of opportunity to solve,

807
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,960
you know, kind of basic problems like

808
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,720
that. and and I would argue build you

809
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,640
know very large uh you know kind of

810
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,720
software and kind of platform style

811
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,039
businesses on the back of that and so

812
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,440
whether it's you know things like you

813
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,880
know um you know a company like salient

814
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,200
which is doing you know bringing voice

815
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,279
agents to uh loan servicing and

816
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,440
collections right the idea that you know

817
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,520
a voice agent can speak in 50 languages

818
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,120
you know fully compliantly track UDEP

819
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,159
you know do welcome calls and payment

820
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,240
reminders um you know and actually

821
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,600
deliver on a better customer experience

822
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,159
because it can speak their native

823
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:19,039
language uh and and get better results.

824
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,480
It's infinitely patient, right? Um you

825
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,559
know, that is a really interesting

826
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,039
opportunity for the moment, you know, in

827
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,159
large part because it's unlocking

828
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,720
markets that were never particularly

829
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:31,120
interesting to soft suffer into because

830
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,279
it budgets were small and now, you know,

831
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,480
the TAM is largely labor. And so that's

832
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,559
been I think kind of one of the

833
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,000
reorientations that we've seen the last

834
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,320
few years from kind of financial

835
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
productled companies largely to uh you

836
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,440
know software businesses and and kind of

837
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,039
financial services we're at large.

838
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,679
>> Zach you you wrote about your

839
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,320
predictions for 2026. Maybe share one we

840
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,440
we haven't uh gotten to yet around where

841
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,559
things are going where you're

842
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,120
particularly excited.

843
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,799
>> I was at a dinner a couple weeks ago and

844
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,720
so this might not be a prediction. This

845
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,279
might just be a recognition of of of

846
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,360
current truth. Um, but I was at a dinner

847
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,720
recently and someone asked the table a

848
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,200
question. Um, and the question was,

849
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,240
"What's the biggest use case um, of AI

850
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,919
in financial services?" And some people

851
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,120
had answers and then it got to me and

852
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,360
and I I kind of flippantly uh said doing

853
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,440
fraud. It turns out the biggest use case

854
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,200
for AI is fraudsters committing fraud

855
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,880
against financial services companies.

856
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,399
Um, and I said it jokingly and then

857
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,760
realized half like as I was saying it,

858
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,919
oh no, this is actually the correct

859
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,120
answer. Um, the entire table was like,

860
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,200
yeah, okay, that's that's the correct

861
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,880
answer. sadly. Um, and so, you know,

862
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,039
we're at this this point in the

863
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,320
ecosystem where AI has so much potential

864
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,200
to change things. And who's using it the

865
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,640
most? It's the fraudsters. Um, and I

866
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,240
like right now we're at a point where

867
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,799
financial fraud is growing at like like

868
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,799
18 to 20% a year. Uh, which is insane

869
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:51,919
and it's already a huge market. Um, and

870
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:55,120
so I guess in that in that vein, um, one

871
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:57,760
of my predictions for, um, 2026 is

872
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,120
unfortunately, um, financial fraud is

873
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,799
going to continue to accelerate in a way

874
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,240
that we don't quite understand and

875
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,559
probably can't quite feel out and

876
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,039
predict yet. Um, because, you know, it's

877
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,399
it's a cat-and- mouse game, but the

878
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,039
mouse is winning right now. I mean, the

879
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,679
cat the cat will win long term, but the

880
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:15,200
mouse is winning right now. And so, um,

881
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,960
it's kind of a depressing prediction,

882
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,039
but, uh, I think likely.

883
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,120
>> What What are you guys doing about it?

884
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,559
>> Well, so we we we build an anti-fraud

885
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,640
product suite. Um, this I promise this

886
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,960
was not me teeing up bragging about why,

887
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,480
but I will I I will gladly brag about

888
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,159
it's a hard it's a hard problem to

889
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,559
solve, but if anybody can kind of try to

890
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,080
figure it out.

891
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,120
>> Well, we we can't solve it all. We can

892
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,880
solve pieces of it. So, we build an

893
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,720
anti-fraud product suite. It's called

894
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,559
Protect. Um within that we have this

895
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,559
analysis of every user and every user

896
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,240
action that uh we can assign a score to

897
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,320
to say what's the trustworthiness of

898
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,880
this user this this account this user

899
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,159
action that they're taking. Um and we we

900
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,600
pull this data and build it based on

901
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,120
looking at every user action that's

902
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,279
taken across every fintech company that

903
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,559
we work with. Um plus uh the data that's

904
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,159
coming from the bank account plus device

905
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,919
data plus a zillion other data sets that

906
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,000
we that we match it all with.

907
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:05,120
>> Um and so it's the first kind of network

908
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,039
linked like cross fintech crossbank uh

909
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,799
type of anti fraud tool. And it's

910
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,399
awesome and and it adds some amazing

911
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,120
signal to to to the companies that we

912
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,440
work with. Um but this is like one of

913
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,360
very many solutions that need to exist.

914
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,960
Um we're starting to get good at

915
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,480
fighting deep fakes as well. I mean like

916
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,480
as an industry and and and plaid

917
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,240
specifically, but like still very early

918
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,279
there. Um but you know this the stuff

919
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,600
that that freaks me out is um you know

920
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,960
have you heard of pig butchering? Um,

921
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,159
for those listening on a podcast, I'll

922
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,640
explain it briefly cuz it's kind of a

923
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,640
gruesome uh term. Um, but it is

924
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,679
basically um when you get a text message

925
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,080
that says, "Hey, how you doing, um, and

926
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,200
that that and you respond to it, don't

927
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,720
ever respond to those, but if you do get

928
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,559
one of those and and and you were to

929
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,679
respond to it, um, they would then

930
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,799
strike up a conversation with you and

931
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,320
eventually they would like find some

932
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,880
complex way to like ask you to give them

933
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,120
money. Um, and when you go up and

934
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,480
execute that transaction, um, you have

935
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,679
just sent money to a total stranger on

936
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,840
the internet and yes, they've stolen the

937
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,000
like that's that that is like in 100% of

938
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,640
cases what happens. Um that used to be

939
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,799
done based on these like like uh human

940
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,080
factories in like Malaysia where they

941
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,760
would like have these people like locked

942
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,840
in rooms sending text messages to to

943
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,159
unassuming people in the US mostly but

944
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,360
but around the world. Um now that's all

945
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,880
AI. You don't need these human factories

946
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,080
anymore. The AI can do all that. Um

947
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,480
India is just getting better and better

948
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,080
and better. Um and like

949
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,240
>> how do we fight that? like because it's

950
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,440
it's a human taking an action that they

951
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,600
think is sending money to a friend and

952
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,520
they've been tricked, but it is fraud,

953
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,399
but it's very hard to to fight that kind

954
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,559
of fraud. So, um

955
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,840
I mean there are so many more tools that

956
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,679
we need to build as an industry

957
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,799
collectively and of course as as plaid

958
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,320
specifically. Totally.

959
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,240
>> We were talking about the different eras

960
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,840
of of fintech. I'm I'm curious what have

961
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,080
been sort of the the different eras of

962
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,760
of plat of of course there was the you

963
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,440
know um sort of the acquisition that

964
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,200
that didn't go through with with with

965
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,880
visa and sort of the ups and downs that

966
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,399
that you guys have had you know

967
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,600
alongside the the macro and obviously

968
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,960
you're in an incredible position right

969
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,240
now is the is talk more about the

970
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,640
different eras of plaid or how the plaid

971
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,720
vision has has evolved or or or you know

972
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,640
or stayed true to the original. So

973
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,240
started Plaid uh started working on the

974
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,240
a thing that wasn't plaid but pivoted

975
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,640
into Plaid in the very end of 2012. We

976
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,799
we launched um we pivoted into what we

977
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,760
were doing in kind of mid late 2013 and

978
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:20,480
launched to the world in 2014. So um you

979
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,840
know it's it's been a good 11 to 13

980
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,519
years depending on how you you count

981
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,919
that uh series of bad products that we

982
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,000
built first. Um David actually was a

983
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,159
friend and knew us then. Um but I'm not

984
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,279
actually brief aside. Um David, I don't

985
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,279
know if you know this. Um David uh found

986
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,519
Plaid. He was the first investor, led

987
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,760
the seed round uh at Spark.

988
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,960
>> Um actually like sourced the deal as

989
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,440
like you were an associate I think at

990
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,919
Spark at the time. Um then he went to

991
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,039
Goldman uh around the time that Goldman

992
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,399
invested. You weren't involved in the

993
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,399
investment specifically, but you were at

994
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,080
Goldman at that time and like probably

995
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,880
helpful in the background. um then came

996
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,480
to Andre and Andre invested um and has

997
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,320
been like a huge friend and supporter of

998
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,919
of plot over the years. So if we owe a

999
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,200
lot to David and a huge amount of thank

1000
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,480
you and he also creates all the

1001
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,399
important industry terms.

1002
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,200
>> Um so you know the fintech industry owes

1003
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,480
a lot to David.

1004
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,480
>> I don't know. Um anyway so uh plaid

1005
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,840
started started call it let's say 2014

1006
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,279
we launched and then 2014 to like 2019

1007
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,799
that was all about linking bank accounts

1008
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,919
like how do we enable you to link a bank

1009
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,519
account so that you can um gain more

1010
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,640
access to financial products broadly so

1011
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,919
link a bank account so you can pay a

1012
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,480
friend on vend link a bank account so

1013
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:30,480
you can get a loan on lending club um

1014
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:33,440
that was kind of phase one kind of 2019

1015
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,480
2020 um you know we called this what

1016
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,559
like like late um uh like late spring,

1017
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:43,120
like looming spring um continuing to

1018
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:45,120
grow in that vein. Um in 2020 um January

1019
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,640
2020, we signed paperwork to sell the

1020
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,399
company to Visa. Um and you know, still

1021
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,600
late spring, uh we didn't know that CO

1022
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,919
was coming. We didn't know that the EDM

1023
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,120
music would turn on. Um

1024
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,039
>> I remember chatting with you, I think it

1025
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,960
was like February or March, you know,

1026
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,320
like it was probably March, right when

1027
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,120
CO was just beginning. I was like, "Wow,

1028
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,399
you really timed that well."

1029
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,080
You know, and then and then the business

1030
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,519
starts ripping and I was like, "Oh,

1031
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,040
that's a very expensive free call

1032
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,200
option." Yeah. You know, on the business

1033
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,119
and so walking away from that is pretty

1034
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,320
>> in an acquisition like at least in our

1035
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,879
acquisition, you sign paperwork that

1036
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,839
says we're in exclusivity and as soon as

1037
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,679
everything is uh cleared, like all the

1038
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,520
check boxes are are checked, then the

1039
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,119
deal will close. Um, and so we had a

1040
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,679
year of exclusivity and and it started

1041
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:32,720
in January of 2020. Um uh and yeah, like

1042
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,800
in in call it like late March of 2020 or

1043
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,720
maybe early April, we were talking and

1044
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,320
it was like, yeah, we have this deal to

1045
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:43,200
sell the company for just over $5

1046
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:46,000
billion and it's fixed price. Um uh Visa

1047
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,839
stock price goes is going down. So like

1048
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,119
all of the the stock compensation that

1049
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,800
we're going to get out of this deal,

1050
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,240
man, that's worth a whole lot more as a

1051
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,760
percentage of Visa. Like we own a large

1052
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,480
chunk of Visa. That that that that seems

1053
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,839
interesting. Um uh and then we looked it

1054
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,200
through the docs and like they have this

1055
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,359
things called like material adverse

1056
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,800
event. Um uh so you can get out of a

1057
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,000
deal if something crazy happens. And

1058
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,520
there was a provision in there that says

1059
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,520
you cannot get out of the deal even in

1060
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,280
the case of a global pandemic. And like

1061
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,480
some lawyer somewhere in some room had

1062
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,680
like come up with like oh let's let's

1063
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,200
just like add this in. Um and I don't

1064
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,560
know we were like oh man this is great.

1065
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,079
We got we got everything set. They can't

1066
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,200
get out of it in case of a pandemic.

1067
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,800
Like we're going to get a huge chunk of

1068
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,680
visa. We're going to be off to the

1069
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,119
races. Um, and then like the deal took

1070
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,240
forever to close because the DOJ was

1071
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,920
investigating Visa for being a

1072
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,599
monopolist and like all this overhead.

1073
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,119
Um, and like kind of for the next the

1074
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,480
next phase the EDM music just like

1075
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,920
started getting louder and louder and

1076
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,760
louder and like summer started happening

1077
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,280
and like fintech started growing and

1078
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,040
people were stuck at home. They needed

1079
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,599
to use digital finance to to live their

1080
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,160
financial lives. Um, and so at the end a

1081
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,760
year later we looked at and we said um,

1082
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,599
for a large variety of reasons it makes

1083
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,119
sense for us to part as friends with

1084
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,320
Visa. Um, and uh, we'll go our own way.

1085
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,839
we'll we'll keep running plat as an

1086
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,400
independent entity. Um and then we

1087
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:59,280
raised a big up round and um you know

1088
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,880
off to the races. But um you know

1089
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,160
through that you tell the company, hey,

1090
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,440
we're selling. Okay, great. That's

1091
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,720
that's a really hard thing to convince

1092
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,560
everybody to still be excited even

1093
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,800
though you're selling the company. A

1094
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,040
year later, hey, we're not selling. Um

1095
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,800
and another very very hard thing uh

1096
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,920
because you're telling everybody um you

1097
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,880
know, you're not going to get all that

1098
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,640
cash that you thought you were going to

1099
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,000
get. Like you can't buy the house. I'm

1100
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,359
sorry, but we'll try to do a secondary

1101
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,440
soon so maybe you can buy a car. Um,

1102
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,800
and you have to like really change the

1103
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,040
culture. It's like almost a reounding

1104
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,280
moment at that point. Um, then you go

1105
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,960
through uh the rest of the summer and

1106
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,520
that was great. Lots of growth, but then

1107
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,599
into like fintech winter and that's

1108
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,440
another like like we got we got to all

1109
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,640
come together like like our customers

1110
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,000
are growing more slowly. Yes, we're

1111
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,640
producing great products. Yes, like the

1112
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,920
plaid is is growing. Um, but like you

1113
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,680
know it's not the growth that we're used

1114
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,000
to because we're in in in in fintech

1115
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,960
winter. Um, and it's nice to finally be

1116
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,640
back in spring, but like there's

1117
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,119
definitely a lot of ups and downs on

1118
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,960
that journey. Like, um, I think it was

1119
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,320
like multiple like refounding or like

1120
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,320
multiple crucible moments along the way.

1121
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,960
>> Was was there a period in that where you

1122
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,480
found your I maybe you always had it uh

1123
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,760
but like your second win because at

1124
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,920
least from the outside it's felt like

1125
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,000
your product velocity really increased

1126
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,680
at some point in the last like you know

1127
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,839
two and a half years.

1128
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,760
>> Yeah. Yeah, it has. I mean I I shifted

1129
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:16,000
my role quite significantly. So like I'm

1130
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,680
I'm our chief product officer like I am

1131
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
in all of the product stuff.

1132
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:23,760
>> Um and a lot of it was like for us

1133
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,040
really it was like building the data set

1134
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,040
to the size that we can actually run

1135
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,119
analytics on it. So we build fraud

1136
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,320
scores that look at um your actions

1137
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,760
relative to every other user that we see

1138
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,480
in our platform and identify if you're

1139
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,240
anomalous. If we didn't have enough data

1140
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,280
to identify if you were anomalous then

1141
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,520
it wouldn't be a relevant score for us

1142
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,800
to build. we got to one enough data and

1143
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,560
then two we finally figured out how to

1144
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,960
like build and watch products quickly.

1145
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,040
Um and so that's been like one of the

1146
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,480
most fun things for me actually. Weirdly

1147
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,640
like

1148
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:55,359
>> I think I was like like not as happy in

1149
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,720
the period of like EDM pumping like fast

1150
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,400
growth everybody's like throwing money

1151
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,760
at fintech like that industry. I think I

1152
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,720
was like a little less happy because I

1153
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,920
was like I don't think I'm adding

1154
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,359
differential value. I think I'm just

1155
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,440
like, you know, running as fast as I

1156
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,720
possibly can and um, you know, maybe I

1157
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,599
make some good decisions, but like, you

1158
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,880
know, it all doesn't matter cuz

1159
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,040
everything's up and to the right.

1160
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,200
>> Um, like I think I was like happier in

1161
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,800
that like winter period.

1162
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,880
>> I'm like, oh man, like this is this is

1163
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,480
where we become an amazing company long

1164
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,079
term. Like this is where like, you know,

1165
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,280
we prove ourselves and and we really

1166
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,480
step up and help our customers. We

1167
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,040
launch the next next wave of products

1168
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,960
that really matter. Um, but I think I

1169
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,560
felt similarly to be honest like you

1170
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,599
know having done fintech since I don't

1171
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:34,880
know 2011 like people

1172
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,960
you know, that felt early, you know, to

1173
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,240
to be investing then and then it's like,

1174
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,599
okay, everybody like, you know, found

1175
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,119
out that this thing existed. Every

1176
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,119
everybody became a fintech investor

1177
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,640
from, you know, 2019 to, you know, 2021.

1178
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,920
And then everybody's, you know, some of

1179
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,200
the best fintech investors in the world

1180
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,320
like came out on podcasts and were like,

1181
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,040
fintech is dead.

1182
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,520
>> Yeah.

1183
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,720
>> I'm like,

1184
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,720
>> fintech is dead. Everyone should go home

1185
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,240
except for people that are building fint

1186
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,880
making

1187
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,000
people that use it.

1188
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,359
>> You guys can leave and just stop

1189
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,640
investing in fintech. We we will

1190
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,240
continue. the fintech team is still

1191
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,160
here, you know, despite the uh the

1192
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,720
naming con

1193
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,440
um

1194
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,599
>> the brand

1195
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,119
>> and uh I think that's that's actually

1196
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,240
benefited us, you know, and I mean

1197
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,839
selfishly, but

1198
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,240
>> but I think it's it's tested the people

1199
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,440
like the true believers and um yeah, I

1200
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,640
in some ways it's brought the community

1201
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,040
together, I would argue.

1202
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,119
>> Yeah. And and you know the the the

1203
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,400
tourists go home like the like and we

1204
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,280
saw it on our team even like there were

1205
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,040
people that joined Plaid in 2020 when

1206
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,640
the the music was loud and it seemed

1207
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,040
like the industry to be in

1208
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,240
>> and you know then they then they they've

1209
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,400
gone and chased the next trend and the

1210
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,720
next trend and um well while well we'll

1211
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,079
miss them and they're nice people. Um

1212
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,359
the people now that are focused on it

1213
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,480
are like these are the people like who

1214
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,400
really want to be here in the long term

1215
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,480
like they deeply believe in the mission

1216
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,520
um and you know they're they're in it in

1217
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,800
the way that we all want to be in it.

1218
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,680
Totally feels great.

1219
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,400
>> Where are we now in the in in the cycle?

1220
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,960
H

1221
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,720
>> how should we think about this moment?

1222
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,000
>> Early to mid-spring, I would say we see

1223
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,280
like green shoots like lots of

1224
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,200
emergence. It's been a pretty good year

1225
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,119
for for many parts of fintech and it's

1226
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,160
been a shaky year for others. I mean, I

1227
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,400
think if you look at the lending

1228
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,079
markets, you know, it's it's not as bad

1229
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,040
as last year, but it's not as good as it

1230
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,800
was. And um

1231
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,839
there are elements of the economy that

1232
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,839
are pretty scary and parts of like a

1233
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,119
large part of of consumer spending is

1234
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,480
being propped up by a small number of

1235
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,599
people. And so like there are all these

1236
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,079
things that are scary but for the most

1237
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,599
part um you know you continue to see

1238
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,480
companies that are building very solid

1239
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:27,359
products. Um you do see like great uh

1240
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,560
startups emerging um but they they look

1241
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,760
a little different than they used to.

1242
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,960
Like they're thinking more responsibly

1243
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,880
about markets in the long term. like

1244
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,119
they're more thinking about uh you know

1245
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,400
profitability and growth and um you're

1246
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:41,440
also seeing like the insanity of of of

1247
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,560
AI funding go on kind of like in AI land

1248
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,440
and some of this starting to bleed into

1249
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,160
fintech because you're seeing these like

1250
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,520
fintech AI uh products start to come. So

1251
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,520
um I would say spring like lots of green

1252
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,320
shoots, lots of exciting stuff. Um still

1253
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,400
some you know still some snow in the

1254
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:57,440
background that's snow melt is still

1255
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,720
happening. Um but uh looking pretty

1256
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,560
optimistic right now.

1257
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,960
>> Awesome. Okay. So let let's let's wrap

1258
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,359
on just what does 2026 and the near-term

1259
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,400
f future look like? Uh David, how we're

1260
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,079
approaching an agency.

1261
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,400
>> It still feels like we're in early

1262
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,839
innings, you know, uh even spring in and

1263
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,160
AI land as well. Um uh you know, so just

1264
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,480
incredibly excited and enthusiastic by

1265
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,920
the momentum we're seeing, you know, for

1266
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,520
again largely software companies selling

1267
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,359
into financial institutions. That's kind

1268
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,560
of been our orientation in the fintech

1269
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:28,240
ecosystem. Um, you know, again, I sat on

1270
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,920
the on the board of a a company called

1271
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,240
Moment, which we, you know, described

1272
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,680
earlier that is uh now bringing some

1273
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,440
largest wealth management platforms

1274
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,160
online. You'll see them, you know, they

1275
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,760
announced LPL. We have another a number

1276
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,800
of other large institutions that we'll

1277
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,560
be announcing uh early next year. Um,

1278
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,760
you know, companies like Modernify,

1279
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,440
which have built uh, you know,

1280
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,599
bank-to-bank deposit marketplaces that

1281
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,040
are really starting to to grow and see

1282
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,839
significant volume in that in that

1283
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,560
network. Um and again just more more

1284
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:58,319
broadly um you know really excited by

1285
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,400
the opportunity for AI to actually do

1286
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,480
the work you know within within these

1287
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,920
institutions and and the momentum and

1288
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,839
excitement you know you know there to

1289
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,359
adopt you know new products

1290
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,480
>> and and are we excited David they're

1291
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,920
they're because they're they're such

1292
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,280
great customers or because they're so

1293
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,280
they're so underserved because they're

1294
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,280
or they're finally transitioning or or

1295
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,200
why have we narrowed in on on that focus

1296
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,800
as one we're particularly excited about?

1297
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,720
I mean, look, the the industry is still

1298
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,640
massive, right? Like if you if I look

1299
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,400
back at at even just Goldman Sachs, and

1300
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:28,319
I know use them as a as an example

1301
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,760
often, but like the the entire firm was

1302
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,040
uh you know, they called the the kind of

1303
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,040
middle and back office the the

1304
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,200
federation. You know, again, these were

1305
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,640
were folks living in Excel largely, not

1306
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,640
using Excel as a modeling tool, but

1307
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,720
using Excel to track work. And so

1308
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,480
there's just such opportunity to build

1309
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,640
amazing software products to solve

1310
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,200
everything from, you know, compliance to

1311
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,960
payments to treasury management to again

1312
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,400
all of the kind of uh, you know, manual

1313
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,920
work that goes into making the financial

1314
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,760
services industry tick. Um, and I think

1315
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,920
AI is again creating kind of a new

1316
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,440
window and wedge opportunity for

1317
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,720
entrepreneurs to kind of, you know,

1318
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,880
build software companies that that

1319
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,040
couldn't have existed years ago. And and

1320
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,800
again, I think the the appetite, you

1321
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,240
know, for adopting new products and new

1322
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,960
software to solve some of those problems

1323
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,240
is is more real than ever. Um because

1324
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,319
again, the most senior people at these

1325
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,599
institutions, uh, you know, can

1326
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,760
intuitively understand the impact that

1327
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,200
AI is having on their business. And so I

1328
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,800
think there's just a lot more

1329
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,520
conversation and momentum happening at

1330
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,720
the board level. um you know and it's

1331
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,720
making the enterprise sort of sales

1332
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,160
cycles you know for for many of even our

1333
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,319
early stage companies happen a lot

1334
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,839
faster than than I've seen in in you

1335
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,480
know my experience you know investing in

1336
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,920
this space. Zach, how about you and h

1337
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,280
how you think about things things at

1338
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,800
Plaid and more broadly?

1339
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,319
>> We

1340
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,720
this past year launched, as I said, the

1341
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:45,119
the anti-fraud suite on Protect uh

1342
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,280
called Protect and um tons and tons of

1343
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,440
acceleration behind that. Uh we launched

1344
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,480
a credit score uh a modern consumer

1345
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,839
credit score that's based on your

1346
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,599
income, your expenses, the things that

1347
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,839
you do in your daily life. So your score

1348
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,160
goes up if you have a higher income. Uh

1349
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:00,079
your score goes down if you start having

1350
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,119
way higher personal expenses, like the

1351
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,160
logical credit score. So we launched

1352
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,599
that, it's called Lens Score. we

1353
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,040
launched that last year. Like these two

1354
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,960
things are going to be major drivers for

1355
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,640
us in the coming year. So um

1356
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,560
distributing this this this new version

1357
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,160
of a credit score um into all the

1358
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,079
lenders and then of course on the

1359
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,160
protect side like helping fight this

1360
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,839
this AIdriven financial fraud that we're

1361
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,760
seeing. Um and then for us like you know

1362
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,200
we're we're we're back to back to like

1363
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,400
hiring and recruiting and and and

1364
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,760
growing and um so you know despite the

1365
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,200
fact that fintech has been through these

1366
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,800
waves like I still think that plat is

1367
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,960
like one of the most amazing places to

1368
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,880
work. Please tell tell all your friends.

1369
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,400
Um if you want to work with big data, if

1370
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,960
you want to have have a hu huge impact

1371
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,200
on consumer's lives, um again financial

1372
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,720
freedom is the the core focus of uh of

1373
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,839
what we do. Um uh and then you don't you

1374
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,599
want to have an opportunity. We we try

1375
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:48,160
to think of ourselves as like the most

1376
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,079
cons consumer sorry the most customer

1377
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,599
centric employer where you know we put

1378
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,280
engineers in the customer so they're

1379
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,440
actually talking to them like we think

1380
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,119
it's an incredibly fun way to work. Um

1381
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,960
so like not forward deployed to

1382
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,119
engineering but Ford deployed company.

1383
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,480
Um, so you know, tell all your fans.

1384
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,079
We're hiring lots of people and uh I

1385
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,720
think it's going to be a great 2026.

1386
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,800
>> Zack, David, you guys are pioneers in in

1387
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,400
in in the in the space in the category

1388
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,640
and I can't wait to have you both back

1389
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,079
in 2030 and we can talk about how the

1390
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,480
how the space has evolved. Uh, thanks so

1391
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,200
much.

1392
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,960
>> Do it sooner.

1393
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,240
>> Yeah, it's so far away.

1394
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,720
>> Exactly. We don't want you to wait, you

1395
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,760
know.

1396
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,520
>> That's true. We don't have to wait every

1397
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,200
5 years. Uh, Zack, David, thanks so much

1398
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,599
for coming to the podcast. Great. Good

1399
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,599
to see you both.
