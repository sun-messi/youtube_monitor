1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
The ARM architecture has existed now for

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,359
almost 30 years and that started from

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,440
early investments from companies like

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,360
Apple, early adopters of the ARM

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,240
architecture that made it the stalwart

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,039
that it is were companies like Nintendo,

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,199
companies like Nokia back in the 80s and

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,960
90s as these smartphone revolution all

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,800
that kind of stuff really started around

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,960
ARM and then that's what's driven us to

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,240
be where we are today. We have big CPUs

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,840
and little CPUs and we're actually

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,519
moving the workloads back and forth

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,800
because certain times you need the

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,800
performance, certain times you don't.

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,600
And so that's really the way these

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,680
devices work where you to your doorbell

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,520
example, you're looking for maybe some

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,440
motion, you're looking for something and

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,040
then once you trigger that event, okay,

21
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,079
now let's fire up some more computing

22
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,239
elements.

23
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,360
>> In business, they say you can have

24
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,000
better, cheaper, or faster. But you only

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,559
get to pick two. What if you could have

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,760
all three at the same time? That's

27
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,559
exactly what Cohair, Thompson, Reuters,

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,879
and Specialized Bikes have since they

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,799
upgraded to the next generation of the

30
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:10,240
cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,720
OCI is the blazing fast platform for

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,240
your infrastructure, database,

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,040
application development, and AI needs

34
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,600
where you can run any workload in a high

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,640
availability, consistently high

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,840
performance environment and spend less

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,000
than you would with other clouds.

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,720
How is it faster?

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,960
OCI's block storage gives you more

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:41,200
operations per second. cheaper. OCI

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,880
costs up to 50% less for compute, 70%

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:49,040
less for storage, and 80% less for

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:52,799
networking. Better in test after test,

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,320
OCI customers report lower latency and

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,840
higher bandwidth versus other clouds.

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,280
This is a cloud built for AI and all

47
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:08,560

That's oracle.comonai.

52
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,040
So

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,280
>> it's great to be here Craig. Thanks for

54
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,120
inviting me. Um, so my name is Chris

55
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,879
Bergie. I'm a senior vice president,

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,760
general manager of the client line of

57
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,480
business at ARM. Um, and that means I

58
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,200
very much focus on all of the rich rich

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,599
edge devices that ARM um, is so

60
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,840
prominent in. So, um, things like

61
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,360
smartphones, but also we're obviously

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,480
making quite a bit of inroads into

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,239
things like PCs. uh we participate all

64
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,360
parts of your house whether that's your

65
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,519
TVs, your smart speakers, um all kind of

66
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,400
rich endpoints that that you have

67
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,760
powered and and are quickly becoming AI

68
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,920
enabled and I think that's what we're

69
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,440
going to talk about today. Craig, um

70
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,200
just a little bit about my background.

71
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,959
I've spent almost 30 years in

72
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,519
semiconductors

73
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,360
um various big companies started out of

74
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,360
school at AMD and and and moved to

75
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,920
Broadcom for almost a decade and and

76
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,159
also did some startups in between. So,

77
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,959
uh, a long I can't believe it's gone by

78
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,560
this this quickly. But, uh, I guess, you

79
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,560
know, semiconductors have never been

80
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,879
this cool as, uh, it seems like

81
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,480
governments and, uh, everyone really

82
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,239
cares about semiconductors. So, I guess

83
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,120
I I was very fortunate in my career

84
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,280
choice.

85
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,319
>> Yeah, that's kind of funny, isn't it,

86
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,879
how things happen that way. Uh, yeah,

87
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,120
and it's uh, and particularly uh,

88
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,480
semiconductors on the edge. That's like

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,680
the the where everything's at right now.

90
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:52,560
Uh so ARM and and we're talking about

91
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:57,200
chips for AI inference. Uh so ARM's uh

92
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:02,239
ARM version 9 edge AI platform has a

93
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:06,560
couple of new uh processors

94
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:09,920
uh designed to enable complex AI models.

95
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,879
Uh, can you talk about those? Uh, or is

96
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,840
there something even more recent that

97
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,519
you want to talk about?

98
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,440
>> Well, I I think that's a good starting

99
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,759
point, Craig. And, you know, and and

100
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,000
we've actually been on quite a journey

101
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,800
um, you know, in the edge evolution, not

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,240
just actually at the sorry, in the AI

103
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,400
evolution, not just at the edge, but

104
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,160
also um, we're actually a big part of

105
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,840
the infrastructure buildout as well in

106
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,000
data centers. it, you know, really

107
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,400
leverages a lot of our business model

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,280
and capabilities and and so we're doing

109
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,360
quite well there as well. Um but but I

110
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,520
I'd like to spoke probably most mostly

111
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,400
about the edge today. And so we we did

112
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,919
create we did a Lumix um our Lumix

113
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,520
platform

114
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,759
um which is really around kind of

115
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,960
high-end smartphones, high-end

116
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,000
multimedia experiences at the edge. Uh

117
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,199
we launched that back in September and

118
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,199
already there's uh several products um

119
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,600
chipsets that have been launched and now

120
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,280
phones that are being launched by um

121
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,320
different leading phone manufacturers

122
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,759
based on Lumix. Um and what's cool about

123
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,919
it is it is the first um it's it's it's

124
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,280
addition to the platforms of V9 as you

125
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:23,440
mentioned that starts rolling outme

126
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:26,720
which is the matrix extensions to the V9

127
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,919
architecture um and and starts pulling

128
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,600
that into the ecosystem to allow people

129
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:38,000
to um really take advantage of AI at the

130
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:41,440
edge in these devices and do so with the

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,880
traditional CPU programming model. Um so

132
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,960
obviously there's a lot of discussions

133
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,320
around accelerators. Accelerators are

134
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,199
great um and and are quite dominant in

135
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,639
data center um and are also finding uh

136
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,880
their home in the edge. Uh but it's it

137
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,440
is always this balance of you know

138
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,400
accelerators have gate great metrics

139
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,560
around maybe tops per watt. Um but they

140
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,440
definitely are a bit more challenging to

141
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,240
program and versus let's say a CPU. And

142
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,720
so you really got to get the reality is

143
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,759
we we talk about heterogeneous computing

144
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,000
because I think the answer is everything

145
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,479
right I think you know in the AI world

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,720
it's about CPU capabilities it's about

147
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,960
GPU capabilities it may be about

148
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,960
dedicated accelerator capabilities and

149
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,919
then it's about memory bandwidth um you

150
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,800
know quite frankly um and really AI is

151
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,680
putting stress on that whole system

152
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,319
>> okay and let's back up a little bit for

153
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,319
listeners that are not deep in the chip

154
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:46,639
space. Uh uh and I' I'd like you to talk

155
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:49,360
a little bit about V9 and what that is.

156
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,319
uh but uh when when you talk about

157
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,520
heterogeneous uh computing what you're

158
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,720
and and and the programming language

159
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,759
uh Nvidia one of the reasons it has such

160
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,360
a strong position is very early on it

161
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:09,120
developed a very uh userfriendly

162
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:13,919
programming language called CUDA and and

163
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:19,120
everyone has adopted that uh for uh

164
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:23,599
programming AI on to uh GPU uh

165
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,240
processors and that has become the

166
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,639
standard and so a lot of new chips are

167
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,520
arriving but you need to learn a new

168
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,960
programming language uh and that's a

169
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,840
barrier but uh you in this heterogeneous

170
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:41,680
particularly at the edge uh what I

171
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,759
understand is that you still use a a

172
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,759
traditional processor with a programming

173
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,160
language that you're familiar amilar

174
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,360
with and then there's some sort of a

175
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:55,280
conversion that sends some of those

176
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,080
workloads to the edge uh chip uh and it

177
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,280
it could all be packaged together but is

178
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,520
is that right?

179
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,199
>> Yeah, I think so. You you you you got a

180
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,240
lot wrapped up into there. So, let me

181
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,599
just first start with V9. So, um the ARM

182
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,120
architecture um has existed now for

183
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,800
almost 30 years. Um and that started um

184
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,479
from early investments from companies

185
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,879
like Apple. Um early uh early adopters

186
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,960
of the ARM architecture that made it um

187
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,840
the the stalwart that it is were

188
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,800
companies like Nintendo, companies like

189
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,520
Nokia back in the you know 80s and 90s

190
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,120
as as kind of the these like you know

191
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,200
the smartphone revolution all that kind

192
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,120
of stuff really started around around

193
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,159
ARM and then that's what's driven us to

194
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,320
be to be where we are today. So V9 is is

195
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,959
is an architecture that we launched

196
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,600
about five or six years ago now um which

197
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,040
was the next generation of architecture

198
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,080
um which was focused on a couple

199
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,720
different things. One was security um

200
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,360
another was performance and third was AI

201
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,760
and um you know we are very much at the

202
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,240
forefront of looking at what these next

203
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,640
generation systems are going to require.

204
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,120
Um, and so that's really what V9 is

205
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,760
about. And at this point in time, um,

206
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,839
you know, a large percentage of both iOS

207
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:16,320
and Android handsets, um, ship with V9,

208
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,800
um, CPUs. Um, and you'll see that

209
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,279
continue to accelerate, um, over the

210
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,760
next couple years. And so and now V9

211
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,080
also is getting perforated across the

212
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,760
other markets that that ARM participates

213
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,800
in whether that's data center whether

214
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:35,120
that's automotive um and then kind of AI

215
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:38,160
IoT as well. So that's that's that's V9.

216
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,240
Um so let's talk about the the

217
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,320
programming uh comment that you made

218
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,560
there. So you're right CUDA is an

219
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,560
amazing language. Um, I've actually had

220
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,519
the pleasure of working very closely

221
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,360
with Ian Buck, who is the I guess, you

222
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,920
know, who basically was the Stanford

223
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,920
student that really kind of started this

224
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,760
and has obviously now uh, you know, has

225
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,519
been a a very important part of the

226
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,320
NVIDIA story and where they're at today

227
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,120
and still still is there today.

228
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,040
um you know but and and it is um a great

229
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,360
program for you know basically

230
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,279
programming um GPUs and especially

231
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,519
taking care taking advantage some of the

232
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:17,200
capabilities um in the accelerators

233
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:20,320
there but you know it is a accelerator

234
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,279
language right um versus a CPU language

235
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,720
and um you know what people do is that

236
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,399
you know you basically have to start

237
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,920
making things like driver calls and you

238
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,040
have to move your workload off of the

239
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,200
CPU to that now it makes a ton of sense

240
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,959
if you're going to get, you know, I

241
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,040
think, you know, Ian and I actually used

242
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,880
to work on on quite a bit of um high

243
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,480
performance HPC stuff for high

244
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,320
performance computing, big government

245
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,000
labs, and we would have these kind of

246
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,880
rules where it would almost want to have

247
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,120
a 100x uplift when you kind of move that

248
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,560
workload over. Maybe at least you'd have

249
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,040
to have 10x, but you'd really want to

250
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,519
have that versus the convenience and and

251
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,279
and keeping it on the CPU because you

252
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,360
really need to load that and then you

253
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,600
stream that workload on an accelerator.

254
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,000
And so that's kind of as you think about

255
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,079
this heterogeneiality of you're really

256
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,079
moving these workloads around based

257
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,480
upon, you know, what's required. Is it

258
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,320
latency? Is it, you know, is it high

259
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,800
performance? Is it lower power? All

260
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,040
those kinds of things. And so this is,

261
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,120
you know, what I would say the ecosystem

262
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,519
is doing, what ARM's focused on is we're

263
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,760
really focused on making all of those

264
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,079
pieces, the CPU be as performant as

265
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,640
possible on AI workloads and be super

266
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,120
developer friendly, which it is. also

267
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,440
moving some of those workloads to GPUs.

268
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,200
ARM is actually, many people don't know

269
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,360
this, but ARM is actually the highest

270
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,360
volume GPU out there. We've shipped over

271
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,120
9 billion um GPU cores um if you because

272
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,880
of the mobile handsets and so much in

273
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,720
the mobile industry that's based on ARM

274
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,600
GPUs. Um and then also in support of

275
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,320
accelerators through um ARM's extension

276
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,000
of our uh architecture and so many of

277
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,720
those accelerators hang off of things

278
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,360
like chai buses or um that are kind of

279
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,160
part of the ARM architecture.

280
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,160
>> Yeah. And and when you say uh the ARM

281
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:11,920
ships GPUs

282
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:13,519
uh where does the uh uh NPU sit in in

283
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,560
fit into all that?

284
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,920
>> Yeah. So, so in a mobile handset, let's

285
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,320
talk about that since that's when we

286
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,839
started. Um, you know, there are, you

287
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,920
know, traditionally there was two large

288
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,279
computing elements or, you know, there

289
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,440
was the CPU and the GPU, right? Um, and

290
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,560
their main function CPU was to run the

291
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,959
OS and then eventually apps. The GPU

292
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,040
function was to display and and play

293
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,040
games and and and do all of those kinds

294
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,760
of things. Well, as these other

295
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,000
workloads become important, whether it

296
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,079
was, you know, camera imaging is

297
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,600
obviously become super important and the

298
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,279
amount of video that you take, well,

299
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,839
then we start putting little

300
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,600
accelerators that are maybe doing um

301
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,079
some of the compression for the

302
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,320
different video codecs and and those

303
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:04,240
kinds of things. And so MPUs have kind

304
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:06,880
of evolved um as a way to efficiently do

305
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,760
matrix multiplications or CNN's and

306
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,519
different kinds of models um in as an

307
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,240
accelerator. And so the system can

308
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,920
choose to send that um but what really

309
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,720
happens in the real world and this is

310
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,040
the heterogeneous is you actually end up

311
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,959
kicking off the job usually on the CPU.

312
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,880
You may actually run it to the GPU. you

313
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,959
may send it to the MPU and then it comes

314
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,680
back to the CPU usually to kind of

315
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,600
conclude and so that's tends to be how

316
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,800
these workloads actually work in a

317
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:38,240
system. It's all uh obviously not seen

318
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,000
by the user. Um but it is the developer

319
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,000
has to make some of those decisions as a

320
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,079
software developer thinking about you

321
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,920
know one kind of capability is in the

322
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,360
handset. They're also making the

323
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,720
decision of do they want to do it on the

324
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,920
cloud or the edge and we should have

325
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,680
that conversation as well today. Um, so

326
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,279
these workloads move around and there's

327
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,480
a whole set of reasons that they move

328
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,959
around, but um, we're making the the CPU

329
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,440
at the edge be as AI friendly as AI

330
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,839
performant um, and power with with a

331
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,839
good power envelope as possible.

332
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,440
>> Yeah. And are these all packaged

333
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:13,680
together, the CPU, GPU, and NPU if

334
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,360
you're using the NPU

335
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,560
>> or are they Yeah,

336
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,959
>> it depends on the system. um in today's

337
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,279
um cell phone chips, yes, they are

338
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,279
largely all in a single SOC. So all

339
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:29,360
these computing elements exist in an

340
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,680
SOC. Um as you get into, you know,

341
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,920
things that have let's say larger, you

342
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,880
know, larger battery windows, you know,

343
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,040
in PCs, many of the NPUs are integrated

344
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,440
in the SOC. We are seeing trends around

345
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,000
people adding accelerators. Obviously,

346
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,240
people are also using the GPU that's in

347
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,600
a um in a in a um laptop or something

348
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,199
like that. And again, that may be

349
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,279
integrated. It may be um discrete. Um I

350
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,760
would say there's a trend towards

351
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:01,360
integration in many of these markets.

352
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,440
And um that is because of the memory

353
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,839
pressure and the memory size

354
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,320
requirements for for AI. And so I think

355
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,680
if you look at some of the latest, you

356
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,560
know, I'm going to say put it on your

357
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,160
desk kind of computing platforms. Um

358
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,040
we're especially proud of our

359
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,560
partnership with Nvidia on the the GB10,

360
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,279
the the product they've actually just

361
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,000
started shipping last week. Um it's

362
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,839
puts, you know, I I think um Jensen

363
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,600
likes to say it puts puts a

364
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,000
supercomputer on your desk, right? where

365
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,839
they're actually um providing I think

366
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,639
it's a pedaflop of AI performance um on

367
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,360
your desk and it is because of you know

368
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,680
you've got these ARM CPUs again um you

369
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,040
know 20 of them coupled tightly to this

370
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:48,079
accelerator with a single memory system

371
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,880
um that offers up to 128 gigabytes of

372
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,480
DRAM and very high bandwidths and so

373
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,800
you've got this whole system that you

374
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,880
can put together uh or that developers

375
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,639
can use and and we're seeing this as a

376
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,519
trend And whether you look at, you know,

377
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,600
the latest V9 M5 that Apple just

378
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,759
announced uh this week as well or I

379
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,839
think it was last week. Um again, you

380
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,880
see amazing AI performance leveraging

381
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,800
the ARM CPUs, uh GPUs and other

382
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,680
accelerators and then a tremendous

383
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,600
memory system um for for that. And so

384
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,120
that's really what we're seeing

385
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,320
happening. And those are integrated. But

386
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,040
some of them as they get a little bit

387
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,800
bigger, they get discrete. Yeah. But the

388
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,639
problem with discrete is then you have

389
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,360
to split the memory system and it it

390
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,759
gets it.

391
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,639
>> Yeah.

392
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,959
>> AI is so memory heavy that it just it's

393
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,759
a it's a whole balancing act.

394
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:39,360
>> Yeah. And again I'm mindful of listeners

395
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,839
who are not uh deep in the chip space.

396
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,040
SOC is system on a chip and that's where

397
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:48,399
you you combine uh different kinds of

398
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,800
chips into one. From the consumer's

399
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,680
point of view it's one looks like one

400
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,040
chip, right? It's all compressed in

401
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,079
there with

402
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:03,519
>> a cover. U and the uh the reason this is

403
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:07,199
important is that increasingly I mean

404
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:09,679
right now I have an app that I built for

405
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,000
myself. When I drive around it talks to

406
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:17,039
me about the history of the places I'm

407
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:20,880
in. Uh, and and it the voice drops out a

408
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:25,919
lot of time because it's got to, you

409
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:29,600
know, read my GPS and send the data to

410
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:33,360
the cloud and then, you know, do a a

411
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:36,880
lookup in in the model, whatever model

412
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,120
I'm I'm using, you know, get the the

413
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,400
text from the model, convert it to

414
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,880
speech, send it back to the the uh

415
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,520
phone, Maybe the the text to speech is

416
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:52,480
on the point. I'm not sure. But but that

417
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:55,200
whole chain uh gets there's a million

418
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,640
ways that it can get interrupted. And if

419
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,720
you have that all happening on device,

420
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,200
you don't have those problems with

421
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:08,559
connectivity and and things like that.

422
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:12,960
Can you talk about how you see uh

423
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:16,320
you know V9 or or these uh these SOC's

424
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,000
uh changing the way we uh we interact

425
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,720
with AI?

426
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,080
>> Yeah, absolutely Craig and and you're

427
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,400
you're at the forefront here. I it um

428
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,200
you know it's it's it's it my job's

429
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,200
super fun because I get to talk to many

430
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,080
of the industry leaders and and

431
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,679
visionaries whether that's both on um

432
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,679
you know companies like Google that we

433
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,960
work so closely with and all the chipset

434
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,400
companies and and then all the the um CE

435
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,520
companies the consumer electronics

436
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,559
companies that are actually putting

437
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,640
these things in your hand. Um, and you

438
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,520
know, it's it's it's fun because you

439
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,200
know, I always I'm an I'm an edge guy. I

440
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,720
think, you know, I want edge computing.

441
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,960
That's kind of that's the business I

442
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,720
run. And so, you know, I you know, of

443
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,080
course, I want edge computing to happen.

444
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,080
And so, but I I do often go to these

445
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,679
partners and say, hey, you know, okay,

446
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,760
why can't you run it in the cloud? You

447
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,760
know, why why can't we do it? You know,

448
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,400
it seems to work just fine. People love

449
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,000
Chad GPT. They love Gemini. You know,

450
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,360
they're starting to really utilize these

451
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,520
services.

452
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,120
And you know they they basically said

453
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,120
you know what what gives me reassurance

454
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,200
is all these companies are like no no no

455
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,280
we need to put these in devices and and

456
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,039
and one of the reasons is what you just

457
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:32,320
said Craig which is you know we the what

458
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:35,280
the goal of AI is that you know we're

459
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,919
seeing some of the early cool use cases

460
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,039
real time translation

461
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,039
um you know some some smart some agents

462
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,120
that are starting to do some things but

463
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,760
we're we're in the early early innings

464
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:52,559
here. And you know, one of the analogies

465
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:55,200
that I like to use is um touch. And if

466
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:58,000
you take a child, let's say less than 10

467
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,000
years old, and you give them a screen,

468
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,400
they just start touching it because they

469
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,600
don't know anything that's not a touch

470
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,520
screen. Um and and you know, whereas you

471
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,520
know, you and I, you know, like the

472
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,799
mouse was a big thing once once we you

473
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,039
know, we thought that was cool. Um, but

474
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,520
and I and I use that analogy because

475
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,760
that is how AI is going to be. If

476
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,280
something doesn't have AI and you can't

477
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,520
interact with it and it can't start

478
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,200
figuring out what you're trying to do,

479
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,559
it's going to be that like that child

480
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,000
that says this thing's not have a

481
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,000
touchcreen. I don't know how to use it.

482
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,679
I don't want to use it. Right? And so,

483
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,159
so first off, you need to just believe

484
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,799
that that is that is how essential this

485
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,559
is going to be. It's it's the you know

486
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,320
it's how annoying it is when it takes a

487
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,240
long time for the app to boot up and

488
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,880
it's how annoying it is if you have an

489
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,600
app die or you know those kinds of

490
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,600
things that we we work out the edges and

491
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,320
they don't really happen as much anymore

492
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,360
but as technolog is new and so it's the

493
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,120
same thing with AI where you know in

494
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,520
talking to one of these partners you

495
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,799
know they said hey Chris we you know

496
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,880
okay yes maybe the AI in the cloud works

497
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,600
great you

498
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,080
90% of the time, but you know, you're

499
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,000
driving up 101. I'm I'm here in in in

500
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,760
Silicon Valley in San Jose. You're

501
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,320
driving up the highway, there's a dead

502
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,400
spot. And you know, and basically,

503
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,159
you're going to get a bunch of latency

504
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,520
that you know, it's not going to become

505
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,799
conversational. You're going to be

506
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,400
waiting. Um, and the reality is is that

507
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,200
people aren't going to comp complain

508
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,120
about to their carrier saying, "Hey, you

509
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,559
got this dead spot on 101. When are you

510
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,480
gonna fix it?" They're going to say,

511
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,640
"Hey, Craig's app. I don't like that

512
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,960
experience. It's frustrating. It doesn't

513
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,720
work. Hey, you know, three times a day.

514
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,640
I'm I'm trying to use it." You know,

515
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,400
it's it's like doing these video calls,

516
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,919
right? When it doesn't take long for

517
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,120
somebody to have a shaky connection,

518
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,960
you're kind of like, "Hey, let's just

519
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,480
talk next week or let's talk [laughter]

520
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,960
in the office, right? It's just too

521
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,280
frustrating." So, that's just one

522
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,880
example. There's privacy, there's

523
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,600
performance, there's all kinds of other

524
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,919
things that is um that really is going

525
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,240
to drive this to the edge.

526
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,799
the the counter side is the models have

527
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,120
to get smaller. there is a real cost

528
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,600
because of the computing and the memory

529
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,480
computing um pressure it puts on it and

530
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,960
so it's a balance but it is happening um

531
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,559
and again training and there'll still be

532
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,960
quite a bit of inference that'll happen

533
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:24,000
in the cloud but as much as we can move

534
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,720
to the edge um I think it's pretty

535
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,720
unilateral whether you're a hyperscaler

536
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,200
whether you're an app developer whether

537
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,360
you're a device manufacturer

538
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,760
all are quite incentivized to try to

539
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,520
make it run very very well on the edge

540
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,520
in the device.

541
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,440
>> But there are challenges and there are

542
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:48,159
trade-offs as you said. Uh one is uh

543
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:52,159
that uh there's a power issue

544
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:55,360
uh and uh a heat issue as a result of

545
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,520
that. Uh how do you manage that? because

546
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,600
and that was I mentioned this company

547
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,799
Brain Chip I had a conversation with

548
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:08,559
that's using neuromorphic chips that

549
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:12,080
only uh fire when the when

550
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:16,080
there's enough activity to wake them up.

551
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,786
So, for example, in a in a

552
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,480
doorbell camera, you don't

553
00:23:17,786 --> 00:23:24,320
[clears throat] want the doorbell

554
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,799
absorbing the the the video, sending it

555
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,120
to the cloud, computing, and sending it

556
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:31,200
back when when there's nothing happening

557
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,360
in the scene. But that's in fact what

558
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:38,559
happens. Uh, how do you manage that?

559
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,320
>> Yeah. So I I think that I mean we we we

560
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,960
have these management techniques that

561
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,520
get used in you know in almost every

562
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,200
aspect of a a computing device right I

563
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,280
mean we get we have very clever

564
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,840
engineers who figure out how to kind of

565
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:54,480
fool you that the device is running full

566
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,000
power yet we're we're obviously very

567
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,080
aggressively changing things in the

568
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,720
background and that that was actually

569
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,320
one of the ARM innovations um over 10

570
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,280
years ago we came up with this big

571
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,559
little concept around we have big CPUs

572
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,080
and little CPUs and we're actually

573
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,000
moving the workloads back and forth

574
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,360
because certain times you need the

575
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,600
performance, certain times you don't.

576
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,400
And so that's really the way these

577
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,640
devices work where you to your doorbell

578
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,480
example, you're looking for maybe some

579
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,400
motion. You're looking for something and

580
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,000
then once you trigger that event, okay,

581
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,240
now let's fire up some more computing

582
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,360
elements. Let's go figure out, oh, it's

583
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,279
a face. Okay, is that a face? We know we

584
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,559
don't. Let's let's trigger the cloud or

585
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,520
whatever. And that's the way these

586
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:38,000
systems work. Um so you know I think it

587
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,120
is about um really these more

588
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,880
intelligent computing platforms um and

589
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,880
getting smarter on how you do these

590
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,279
accelerators and that's you know that's

591
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,360
for example our our the theme I

592
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,880
mentioned that's part of this theme 2

593
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,799
that's part of V9 um it is this kitely

594
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,679
coupled accelerator but we do it in a

595
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:00,000
very very efficient manner um where it's

596
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,720
actually shared across multiple CPU

597
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,520
cores so you're also being very area

598
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,240
efficient um which really drives cost.

599
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,360
Um so I mean those are things but the

600
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,640
other thing is there's tons of

601
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,679
innovation. Um I I again don't want to

602
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,840
get too technical but your your your uh

603
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:21,360
listeners maybe have heard about HBM

604
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:24,159
right HBM memory is stacked DRAMM with a

605
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:27,440
very high bandwidth interface and it's

606
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:29,600
become a huge en enabler for

607
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,200
um AI in the cloud right because we have

608
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,799
to have all this memory bandwidth and we

609
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,960
put these HBM stacks next to these

610
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,600
accelerators we're looking at very

611
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,799
similar things um at the edge relative

612
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,480
to you know if where where is the power,

613
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,960
right? Is it in the computing element?

614
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,919
Is it in the jewels per bit of memory

615
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,080
transfer? All of these things are

616
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,600
opportunities for innovation and there's

617
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,360
a ton of research and a ton of

618
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,039
investment that's going into them. So I

619
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,960
I don't worry about the power. I

620
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:02,880
actually think the power is fairly

621
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,640
manageable relative to uh inference. I

622
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,520
think the bigger pressure we have right

623
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:11,600
now is actually memory uh memory size.

624
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,360
Um so the model size and um and how how

625
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,200
big it how how do we make it small

626
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,080
enough because at the end of the day

627
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,480
that drives um it drives cost it drives

628
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,159
power and other kinds of things. So it

629
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,960
it's happening and the good news is

630
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,559
we're in this innovation cycle where you

631
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,320
know there's two things you can do. You

632
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,480
can shrink the model and get the same

633
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,559
performance and and that seems to be

634
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,799
shrinking you know almost you know 50% a

635
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,720
year if not faster than that. And on the

636
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,039
other side, you can say, hey, I want a

637
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,120
three gig, you know, gig, three billion

638
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,360
parameter model, and it's just getting

639
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,200
more and more intelligent every every

640
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,480
six months, every year, right? And so

641
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,240
there's different ways to solve the

642
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,000
problem, but this is that's really the

643
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,120
enabler, I think.

644
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,720
>> Yeah. And again, I'm just thinking about

645
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:01,760
listeners so that so we don't lose them.

646
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,520
is scalable matrix uh extension and

647
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:09,039
that's a a way to optimize the the math

648
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:13,200
operation correct uh that's that's used

649
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:17,039
>> um and uh are you you know on the models

650
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:20,960
uh are you guys exploring state space

651
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:24,640
models uh that optimize memory usage I

652
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:28,240
mean that have a different uh way of

653
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:31,520
handling uh uh memory

654
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,200
Um so I'm not as familiar personally

655
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,679
with states spate. I I think I

656
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,320
understand the general concept of it. Um

657
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:41,039
I would say that you know we provide

658
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,840
this platform that many of these

659
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:46,960
innovations sit on top. So you know many

660
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,200
of the um what we've basically done with

661
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,360
for example our our matrix extension

662
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,360
engine that you just talked about uh we

663
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,760
basically built what we call clidy

664
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,760
framework on top of it which is these

665
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,799
libraries that now developers can

666
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,880
basically leverage so it just does the

667
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,039
right thing in the hardware relative to

668
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,919
taking advantage of which you know do

669
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:10,799
you have the latest RMV9 etc. So a lot

670
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,039
of those how the model works and states

671
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,960
fates and and what you know are they

672
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,120
using a KV cache or how are they doing

673
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,039
the different updates those actually sit

674
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,679
at a little bit higher level in the

675
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,840
stack where we're kind of more of a I

676
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,679
guess a plumbing enabler is kind of the

677
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,520
way that I would say it. So we we

678
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,559
support all of that and we're making it

679
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,480
super easy for developers to um to

680
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,880
explore that and and to build their

681
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,399
innovations on top. But there's nothing

682
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,320
unique at least at this point in time

683
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:42,000
that we're necessly doing from a state

684
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:45,279
state point of view in in our CPUs

685
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,399
>> and can you talk us about some of the uh

686
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:51,679
the current applications

687
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:55,360
uh and where you see this going this

688
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:57,279
move to the edge? Uh I mean obviously

689
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,640
uh

690
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:03,600
you know uh self-driving cars is is one

691
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,399
where you you can't afford to risk

692
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,640
connectivity and latency by sending data

693
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:13,360
to the cloud. It's got to be computed on

694
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:16,159
uh on the platform or on the on in the

695
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:19,200
car. uh what are some of the other

696
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:23,279
applications that you're currently

697
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:26,559
uh putting chips into uh and or current

698
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:29,679
devices I should say and and where do

699
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:32,240
you see that going I mean how another

700
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:36,080
the form factor of these chips how small

701
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,080
can they be uh so that they're they're

702
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:42,000
sitting I mean I was talking to a guy

703
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,760
the I wear hearing aids uh that uh you

704
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,240
know you'll be able to have these chips

705
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:51,360
in the hearing aid uh you know filtering

706
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,919
or or isolating sound and that sort of

707
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,880
thing. Uh so can you talk about that a

708
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,159
little bit?

709
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:01,360
>> Yeah, I mean that's a great question. I

710
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:03,279
I mean I think the scalability is almost

711
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,440
everywhere, right? I mean your your

712
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,360
hearing aid example is a good example

713
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,240
and and and this is one of the reasons

714
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,559
why ARM builds the the huge set of

715
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,240
portfolio that we do because we are in

716
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,080
many of those those hearing aids and

717
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,320
those kinds of things and we've we've

718
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,480
actually announced AI across I mentioned

719
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,760
Lumix but we have our edge AI platforms

720
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,640
that we've also announced back in

721
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:28,960
February. So we are enabling that. Um

722
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:32,720
and it um it it just comes down to if

723
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:36,320
you know the task you are trying to do

724
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,559
you can make things quite small and um

725
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,799
and efficient right so in a hearing aid

726
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,960
right in a hearing aid you're probably

727
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,679
not trying to run a large language model

728
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,080
not yet at least um you're doing things

729
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,320
like trying to do you know reduce noise

730
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:53,200
or picking out you know amplifying only

731
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,440
the the interesting you know what what

732
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,200
are you trying to hear. Now, obviously

733
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,960
adding translation and those kinds of

734
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,840
things are probably going to be possible

735
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,760
soon. Um, now if I know what language

736
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,600
I'm translating to, then I can, you

737
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,120
know, that going to make my model

738
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,480
smaller. Uh, but yeah, everything, um,

739
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,200
you know, one of the things that I like

740
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,840
to think about is how much, you know, we

741
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,600
use apps today to configure things. Like

742
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,799
a good example is like a security

743
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,720
camera, right? So today you probably you

744
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,399
know when you try to install your

745
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,840
security camera in the past you would

746
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,679
have went to your laptop and and

747
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,240
connected it. Now probably use your

748
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,000
smartphone to do that. Well, you know

749
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,320
that is a use model. We've gotten used

750
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,399
to it. But but why can't you just do it

751
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,640
with your voice? Like why can't it talk

752
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,799
to you and have the the camera have a

753
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,799
large language model and you say hey it

754
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,720
asks for what is your SSID? Here are the

755
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,240
ones I see. And you know now again that

756
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,240
may or may not be a better user

757
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,799
experience but we just see the

758
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,120
applicability across the board. Again I

759
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:56,480
I use that touch analogy because touch

760
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,960
has become so prevalent. AI is going to

761
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,399
be way more prevalent than even touch is

762
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,880
today in changing the use model how you

763
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:08,080
interact with these things. Um you know

764
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:11,200
a a great example I'll give you Craig is

765
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,440
we work very closely with Meta um who is

766
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,519
is is really doing a great job. I think

767
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,440
with with the you know some of the

768
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,960
advances in their glasses, right? So the

769
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,880
the XR glasses um and their and the

770
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,840
product they just announced two weeks

771
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,600
ago, three weeks ago um they they now

772
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,600
have a wristband that goes with that

773
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:34,240
product and and that actually uses one

774
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:36,320
of our Ethos uh NPUs which is again

775
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,200
super small, super low power that you

776
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,120
can have this wristband that basically

777
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,960
you know has a huge battery life. I

778
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,279
forget how many days or weeks you can

779
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,600
wear it. And it literally just, you

780
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,440
know, you manipulate things just by

781
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:54,000
moving your fingers like this. And it

782
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:56,000
senses in your wrist the changes and

783
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,120
what's happening, you know, below your

784
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,120
skin using AI to basically figure out

785
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,440
that, oh, you just did your second

786
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,360
finger, so that's going to do this or

787
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,519
you just did this, so that's or, you

788
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,039
know, you're doing this. So basically

789
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:14,559
that is the new UI of a wristband that

790
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:16,559
has AI in it that has you know a long

791
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,240
long battery life and has a tiny tiny

792
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:22,159
battery. That's that's how small we can

793
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:27,600
make AI for very specific use cases.

794
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:31,919
>> Yeah. Uh and and what's the focus uh

795
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,240
with with ARM right now? Is it reducing

796
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:38,080
size? I mean obviously it's going to be

797
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,960
all these things but but where do you

798
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,960
see the next breakthrough? Is it

799
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,640
reducing size, reducing power

800
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:52,559
consumption, increasing the model size

801
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:55,108
that can can be uh on these chips? Uh

802
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,760
yeah, where where do you see it going?

803
00:33:55,108 --> 00:33:57,840
[gasps]

804
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:01,440
Um, it's a great question, Craig, and it

805
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,519
it is a it is a a very open design space

806
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,640
right now to be honest with you. Um, you

807
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,720
know, definitely there has been a focus

808
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,560
on power in the past and that's kind of

809
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,639
where our ethos product line comes from

810
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,720
and but a lot of that was around CNN

811
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,399
networks and some of the early stuff.

812
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,879
Now you're starting to see the move to

813
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,800
transformer networks. What's next?

814
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,639
Right? I don't think that transformers

815
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,879
are actually the end goal. And so we

816
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,679
also need to allow flexibility as these

817
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,839
models change because you know back to

818
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,960
kind of educating your users. I mean it

819
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:37,040
takes two years almost at a minimum to

820
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,839
design silicon and get it in a shipping

821
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,359
product and you can see how fast AI is

822
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,000
moving. Um yeah

823
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,919
>> and so there's also this flexibility

824
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,760
piece but I I think most of it is

825
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:51,440
performance. it's really memory

826
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,720
performance and it's um and it's tops

827
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,839
and and CPU performance and then um and

828
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,839
and trying to shrink that down as as as

829
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,359
the best we can for for whatever the

830
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:05,040
power envelope is to um you know how

831
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,359
much computing you can get and I think

832
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,920
that's obviously happened in the data

833
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:11,440
center as well right where it's okay

834
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,640
we're trying to get we're now building

835
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,320
gigawatt data centers but how much how

836
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,920
you know how many tokens can you create

837
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,839
How much performance can you get in

838
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,839
that? So almost everywhere in the space,

839
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:25,280
it's like, okay, tell me what your power

840
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:28,000
envelope is. It's a gigawatt here. It's,

841
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,000
you know, seven six watts in a phone.

842
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,760
It's, you know, in my wrist example,

843
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,680
it's literally, you know, a couple

844
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,599
hundred mills.

845
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,079
You know, how much AI performance can

846
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:41,119
you get? And so it it really is spanning

847
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:45,839
a a large um space.

848
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:48,800
>> Yeah. And you guys don't uh

849
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:52,160
you're you're producing IP, right?

850
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:56,400
You're not uh building uh you don't have

851
00:35:52,160 --> 00:36:00,079
a fab. You're not uh uh sending your

852
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,160
designs out to a fab to make your chips.

853
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,760
You're licensing this to other chip

854
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,680
makers.

855
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:10,079
>> That's correct. Yes. Our business model

856
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:12,160
is we provide IP to uh you know the a

857
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,480
large portion of the semiconductor

858
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:19,280
ecosystem. Um and um and then our

859
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,280
partners build on top of it and create

860
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,839
uh create silicon solutions that can

861
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,000
span like we talked about anything from

862
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:28,480
you know a wristband or or your hearing

863
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,880
aid to uh you know your next

864
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,599
self-driving car.

865
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,400
>> Yeah. Yeah. And and where is most of

866
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:40,160
this? Um I mean obviously most of it's

867
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:44,880
going into the US, but uh do you have

868
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:48,320
partners that are are licensing your IP?

869
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,320
Uh where what are the other markets that

870
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,560
you're operating in?

871
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,040
>> Well, you know, I would say that

872
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,000
traditionally semiconductors have been

873
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,400
quite global, right? um you know that

874
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,599
the the cost of developing a

875
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,359
semiconductor is tremendous right um

876
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,280
obviously the foundry cost and I'm not

877
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:10,480
even saying like put aside the foundry

878
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,480
costs um but literally building a chip

879
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,320
um you know if you're example if you're

880
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,720
using u one of the latest nodes um just

881
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,400
the mass costs alone of of when you're

882
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,280
done your design and getting that

883
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,160
manufacturer is in the tens of millions

884
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,480
of dollars um the development costs up

885
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,720
front can often be in the hundred

886
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,440
million plus range. So you're talking

887
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,960
about tremendous amount of cost to get

888
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,040
to the first unit. Um but what's made

889
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,720
semiconductor so great is that you can

890
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,720
scale that and because we have these

891
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,560
amazing manufacturing capabilities etc.

892
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,800
And so they tend to be very large

893
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,880
markets and so generally it's been a

894
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:53,440
global market for us. Um and yes, um you

895
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,680
know, obviously, um there's many great

896
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,640
IC or semiconductor companies in the US

897
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,800
that do designs. Um we work very closely

898
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,280
with with European semiconductor

899
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:08,880
companies, uh in Taiwan, in Korea, um as

900
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,760
well. And um we also have had a um armed

901
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,240
China, a JV where um semiconductors get

902
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,440
built in China based on our IP. And so

903
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:21,680
it we get uh it's pretty global market.

904
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:24,160
Yeah. Uh I would imagine the Chinese uh

905
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,400
relationship has been strained by the

906
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,160
sanctions. How does that affect you

907
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,280
guys?

908
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:34,240
>> Well, yeah. I mean, we always make sure

909
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:37,760
we're following the local uh laws and

910
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:40,160
obviously where we're located. Um most

911
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,000
of the constraints have been around the

912
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,960
manufacturing process and not

913
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,760
necessarily um some of the IP. there is

914
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,040
some around IP enablement but um you

915
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,880
know it's something that we always are

916
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,960
very careful about make sure we're we're

917
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,800
complying to what is required um and uh

918
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,560
and we'll see as things evolve

919
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:04,720
>> in that that you guys are uh are

920
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:07,200
primarily selling IP uh do you work with

921
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,800
a large developer community and what's

922
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:14,800
that relationship like uh is how much of

923
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:18,160
this is open source for example and Um,

924
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,640
and then if you could talk about where

925
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,040
you see I mean you mentioned wearables

926
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,000
where wearables are going to be a hot

927
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:31,440
thing where you see the edge really

928
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:34,402
exploding the public u uh interaction or

929
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,560
experience with AI.

930
00:39:34,402 --> 00:39:36,720
[snorts]

931
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,800
>> Okay. Yeah. So I mean let's let's start

932
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,640
about developers. So you know ARM is um

933
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,520
you know developers are super important

934
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,320
to ARM and in fact we now have uh the

935
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,640
world's largest developer ecosystem. We

936
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,960
believe we have over 22 million software

937
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,920
developers that are developing software

938
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,880
on ARM. Um and that's just because of

939
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,520
our our footprint um that spans all the

940
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,240
way from you know iOS to now Windows on

941
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:07,040
ARM and then of course things like um

942
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,520
Chrome, Android and Linux. um you know

943
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,839
we've been a longtime supporter of so um

944
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:15,599
you know really the the world's largest

945
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:18,400
software ecosystems are um quite uh you

946
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,359
know work work closely with ARM um and

947
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,200
we we support them and uh and we really

948
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,040
focused on that developer experience and

949
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,560
and how do we improve that developer

950
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,800
experience I mentioned uh CID before in

951
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,800
this in this conversation that's really

952
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,240
about again trying to make it seamless

953
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:39,280
for developers to use AI because you You

954
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,599
talked about CUDA AI is not um simple

955
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:45,040
from many of the programming elements

956
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:48,079
and I would say we're still seeing

957
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,240
not necessarily the hardware abstraction

958
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,560
that we've gotten other software

959
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,280
ecosystems to. We still see a fairly

960
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,680
tight coupling to today's models to

961
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,680
actually the hardware that they run on.

962
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,599
Um whether that's the operators they

963
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,119
support, whether that's you know the way

964
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,960
they kind of assume the model is going

965
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,680
to propagate and those kinds of things.

966
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,359
So um you know but we are we're clearly

967
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,760
focused on the supporting those

968
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,359
developers and uh and and seeing what

969
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,359
they can build right and I think that

970
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:19,119
kind of goes to your second question of

971
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:21,760
you know what's kind of on on the

972
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,960
forefront uh and that's why what makes

973
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,960
my job so fun because I get to to to to

974
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,599
interact with so many of these super

975
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,760
innovative folks u both startups and

976
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,480
establish established companies on kind

977
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,119
of what is next or what what's the art

978
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,560
possible. Um, and and if I was just to

979
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:44,800
use a general concept, it would just be

980
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:48,560
intelligence. The idea of something is

981
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:51,440
capable of interacting with you in a way

982
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:54,000
that exceeds your current expectations,

983
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:57,599
right? And you maybe I'll use another

984
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,400
product example. Um, I'm a huge Amazon

985
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,760
fan. Um, but one of the things I've

986
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,720
noticed is that before I upgraded to

987
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:09,359
Alexa plus, you know, because of the way

988
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,880
I was using a chatbot or chat GPT or

989
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,680
Gemini,

990
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,200
I started talking to it in a in a more

991
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,800
conversational manner because that's

992
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,839
what I could do. But then when I would

993
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,839
come home and use Alexa, it wouldn't

994
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:24,160
necessar it was expecting more of kind

995
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,839
of a search kind of give me, right? you

996
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,680
know, really break it down pretty, you

997
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:30,240
know, I'm giving you three words and try

998
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,680
to contextualize those three words, you

999
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,359
know, and so and I think, by the way,

1000
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,640
Amazon's done a great job with Lexa Plus

1001
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,560
and I think they're they're on the right

1002
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,319
path here. But that's just a change in

1003
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:41,599
expectations and I and I think that's

1004
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:44,880
going to only go, you know, just through

1005
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:47,680
the roof relative to, you know, the idea

1006
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,760
of, you know, the things that we think

1007
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,880
are how you interact with a device for

1008
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,560
it just to be smart. Um, you know, one

1009
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,839
of the things people ask me about is

1010
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:00,240
like what's a gentic AI or how's that

1011
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:01,839
going to feel, right? And and one of the

1012
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,400
things I like to use and I think I think

1013
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:06,560
Microsoft has done an amazing job of

1014
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,280
really integrating AI into their

1015
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,119
products as large as a company they are,

1016
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,280
you know, the way they push copilot, all

1017
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:17,359
those kind of things. But what I like is

1018
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:19,440
a is a a silly example of settings. So,

1019
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:23,119
when you use Windows in Windows

1020
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,599
settings, we've all done it and you have

1021
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,599
to figure out, okay, I want to add a

1022
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,240
screen or I don't like this resolution

1023
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:33,200
screen. How many like windows do you

1024
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,119
have to click in to kind of say figure

1025
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,640
out how to make this change, right?

1026
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,960
Well, they've changed it to be more of

1027
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,640
an agentic experience in Windows 11

1028
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,280
where you just say, what do you want to

1029
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,440
do? I want to add a screen. I want to

1030
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,880
reduce this. And it just says, okay,

1031
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,839
well, here's how you do it. or I'll do

1032
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,079
that for you. And so, you know, to me

1033
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:55,200
that's a touchyfey thing of how many

1034
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,040
times do we, you know, click through

1035
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,560
three apps. Oh, I'm going to cut this

1036
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,240
now. I have to go to my flight app. Then

1037
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,079
I have to go to my rental car app. Then

1038
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,359
I like, you know, so many of these

1039
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,040
things that we're just trained to think

1040
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:07,520
like, oh, it works good enough. I you

1041
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,160
know but like this idea of things are

1042
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,839
just so smart that you know when you

1043
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,440
call an Uber it of course knows where

1044
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,800
you're going to go and it's already told

1045
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,040
people when you're going to show up and

1046
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,040
and all these kinds of things. So you

1047
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,680
know those are and of course those are

1048
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,640
consumerry examples. There's huge amount

1049
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,800
of enterprise examples of you know teams

1050
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,319
that are not you sharing data or people

1051
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,880
don't understand or they're looking for

1052
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,079
information they can't find. Um, and so

1053
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,000
I think it's just going to be the

1054
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,599
general idea of just how do we make

1055
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,760
things just super smart um, and really

1056
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,640
kind of exceed expectations of what

1057
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:46,400
technology limitations are today.

1058
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:49,359
>> Yeah. Yeah. And robotics is is another

1059
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:52,400
one. I'm not a great believer in

1060
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:55,599
humanoid robotics. I think we're a long

1061
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:59,119
way from that. But uh what you're

1062
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:02,960
describing I mean it's u you know the

1063
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:06,400
day will come when uh our children or

1064
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:09,520
grandchildren will will look back and

1065
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,920
can you believe that you know any object

1066
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:15,119
that you use daily

1067
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:18,000
uh was a dumb object back then instead

1068
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:21,760
of being able to talk to it and and have

1069
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,319
it like configure itself or or whatever

1070
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,960
it is. And that that's pretty exciting.

1071
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:30,640
What about robotics? Uh I mean obviously

1072
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:33,599
you guys uh are involved in that.

1073
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:36,079
>> Yeah, I mean it's pretty amazing the

1074
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,079
what's what's happening there. Um and

1075
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,720
the ability to train the robots in

1076
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:43,040
virtual worlds as well as real worlds.

1077
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,960
Um and we are a huge believer in that

1078
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,079
and and and we're quite involved with

1079
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:50,319
many of the ecosystems. Um, you know, I

1080
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:53,440
think it is really taking the advantage

1081
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:55,760
of all, you know, the camera sensor has

1082
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,359
been an amazing enabler, right? If you

1083
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,000
just look at what our cell phones are

1084
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:02,079
able to do in capturing images, but

1085
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,359
really the the camera sensor has now

1086
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:07,040
unleashed this idea of physical AI and

1087
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:10,079
how do you, you know, because we can use

1088
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,760
vision systems and AI is so good with

1089
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,640
vision systems, right? whether that's

1090
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,880
looking at an MRI and or you know maybe

1091
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,880
and and augmenting a doctor's reading of

1092
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,440
that or in a system and trying to

1093
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,960
understand what's going on. So it is it

1094
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,920
is a huge area. I think we're going to

1095
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,960
see a lot of um innovation. I think you

1096
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,480
know to your robotics example you know I

1097
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,240
think I don't know go back to the

1098
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,760
Jetsons or whatever. I mean people said

1099
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,640
we're gonna have flying cars and they

1100
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,760
were going to be able to do all these

1101
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,839
autonomy things. It's taken a long time,

1102
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,319
but you know, another great ARM powered

1103
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:44,640
device, my Tesla, you know, it has

1104
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:48,720
gotten pretty darn good relative to

1105
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:51,599
self-driving and and and I really enjoy

1106
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,160
having that augment me in in many, many

1107
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:56,000
scenarios. And so, it is, like you said,

1108
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,040
it's going to just be an expectation and

1109
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,040
you're just going to be disappointed

1110
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,119
when it doesn't do something that they

1111
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:03,040
clearly can't do today. But these things

1112
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:07,520
are hard. I mean, you know, I think that

1113
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:09,280
that blend of physical um and and

1114
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:12,079
you know, is going to be a hard thing,

1115
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:15,359
but like anything, it's probably, you

1116
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,920
know, I go back to I was involved with

1117
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,040
Bluetooth in the early days and and you

1118
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,319
know, oh, it's going to be amazing.

1119
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,480
You're going to have all these Bluetooth

1120
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,680
devices and just and and it it didn't

1121
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,280
work great in the beginning. The

1122
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,680
experience wasn't great, but just look

1123
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,440
at how fundamental Bluetooth is today.

1124
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,520
Again, when I walk up to my Tesla, it

1125
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,839
just unlocks. It just like it locks.

1126
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:36,640
and that's all over Bluetooth and

1127
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:39,040
augmented by UWB or you know so it's it

1128
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,720
it's just these technologies you know

1129
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,640
sometimes the hype cycle gets a little

1130
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,800
bit ahead of expectations and that's

1131
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,000
that's our fault as technologists but at

1132
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,240
the end of the day the technology

1133
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,200
delivers and uh and it's going to be an

1134
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,960
exciting future for um our children and

1135
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,079
grandchildren.

1136
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,400
>> Yeah, absolutely. And yeah, with moving

1137
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:03,200
into physical, the challenges aren't

1138
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:07,200
really uh the AI, it's the it's the

1139
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:10,079
mechanics, the actuators and and the the

1140
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,640
wear and tear and the dust and the

1141
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,480
grease and all that stuff that people

1142
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:18,000
kind of forget about.

1143
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:24,000
>> Uh that that's that's it's still got a

1144
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:26,400
long ways to go. Um yeah. Okay. Uh so so

1145
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:31,119
is ARM on the verge of announcing

1146
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:35,920
anything uh new or is this uh is it

1147
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:37,760
really the uh the V9 that you're

1148
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,000
>> well you guys are focused on

1149
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,160
>> we we've got quite a broad product set

1150
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,760
of products right so yes I you know I

1151
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,000
have my responsibilities but we have a

1152
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,839
whole automotive and and robotics group

1153
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,480
we have a whole group that focuses on

1154
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:53,280
data center same thing with edge AI and

1155
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,640
and additional intelligence So, uh, I

1156
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,040
think you'll keep seeing quite a bit

1157
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:59,520
from us. Uh, lots of great stuff going

1158
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,040
on and, um, and again, we're just super

1159
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,800
excited about the partnerships that we

1160
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,400
get to partner with and how much

1161
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,240
developers,

1162
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,200
um, and hopefully some of your listeners

1163
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,680
are inspired to, uh, build things on top

1164
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:14,000
of the ARM architecture and uh, and help

1165
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,079
make the future what it's what's what's

1166
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,014
show us what's possible.

1167
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,920
>> Yeah. And and on that note,

1168
00:49:18,014 --> 00:49:22,720
[clears throat] we'll end on that. uh

1169
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:26,640
developers if they're interested uh do

1170
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:29,359
you have a a portal developer portal?

1171
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:33,280
>> We do. developer.arm.com.

1172
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:36,640
Um great great resource to uh to find

1173
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:39,280
out more figure out how to um you know

1174
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,599
build and and uh and explore many of

1175
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,280
these new technologies. Um obviously

1176
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,000
many of the makers are familiar with

1177
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:48,160
Raspberry Pi. That is a uh also

1178
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,960
ARMPowered and something that many um

1179
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:53,680
you know kids and and ele uh educators

1180
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,040
start um start their journey and and

1181
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,599
those things are getting super excited

1182
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,839
now with robotics and and beyond.

1183
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:02,960
>> In business they say you can have

1184
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:05,599
better, cheaper or faster but you only

1185
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,160
get to pick two. What if you could have

1186
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:11,359
all three at the same time? That's

1187
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:14,160
exactly what Cohair, Thompson, Reuters,

1188
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:16,480
and Specialized Bikes have since they

1189
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:20,400
upgraded to the next generation of the

1190
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:23,839
cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

1191
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:26,240
OCI is the blazing fast platform for

1192
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:29,760
your infrastructure, database,

1193
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:32,640
application development, and AI needs

1194
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,119
where you can run any workload in a high

1195
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:38,160
availability, consistently high

1196
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:41,440
performance environment and spend less

1197
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:45,280
than you would with other clouds.

1198
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:48,319
How is it faster? OCI's block storage

1199
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,839
gives you more operations per second,

1200
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:54,000
cheaper.

1201
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:58,480
OCI costs up to 50% less for compute,

1202
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:02,640
70% less for storage, and 80% less for

1203
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:06,400
networking. Better in test after test,

1204
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:09,920
OCI customers report lower latency and

1205
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:13,440
higher bandwidth versus other clouds.

1206
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:16,800
