1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,720
So it was always this thing about push

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,279
yourself, don't sit idle. Satan has work

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,599
for idle hands. If you can read in every

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,679
spare minute, do it. So that's the

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,280
environment we grew up in. And we

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,519
couldn't go complain to somebody else

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,600
because our entire community was that

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,439
way. And so you sit there going, who am

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,800
I going to complain to? If I complain to

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,880
an aunt or an uncle, they'll say, oh,

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,320
I'm doing the same with my kids. So we

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,039
grew up in an environment where

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,599
everybody was being pushed. And we were

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,359
being pushed because we were growing up

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,320
in an environment where India had just

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,079
come out of 350 years of British rule

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,160
and it was trying to find its place in

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,559
society and we were looking at other

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,640
countries and saying wow you know there

20
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,200
could be growth there can be innovation

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,239
the economy could get a whole lot better

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,840
and so everybody needs to pull

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,360
themselves up to contribute to the

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,000
country in order to make the country

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,800
better. So that was the goal to push

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
young people. And so you sit there

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,600
going, I have to pull myself up. The

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,680
family pushed you, but you have to pull

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,400
yourself up. Everything in my childhood

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,720
was about that. It was about working

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,479
hard, being a team member at home, doing

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,760
chores, uh not having much money at all,

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,040
but lots of discipline, uh freedom

34
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,720
within a frame. That's what I remember.

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,560
Uh but work hard, study hard, and be

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,360
viewed as a reliable person. If you

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,880
promise something, deliver it. Okay?

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,880
Unless you're dead, you will deliver it.
