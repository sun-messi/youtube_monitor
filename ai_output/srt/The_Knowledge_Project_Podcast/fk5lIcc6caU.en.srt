1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,400
when you were like the CEO of Pepsi, did

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,000
that change how you developed people

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,759
where the best thing for Pepsi might

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,040
have been for them to stay, but the best

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,160
thing for them might have been for them

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,000
to leave?

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,200
>> Well, at some point when people come to

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,240
you and say, "I've got this great

9
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,400
opportunity." You sit there going, would

10
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,080
they be better off leaving? And in case

11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,160
I want them back, I can always go back

12
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,560
and get them. Or are they better off

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,560
staying at PepsiCo? Sometimes selfishly

14
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,560
I'd look at this and say I'm actually

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,080
better off if this person go goes and

16
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,679
gets this completely different

17
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,559
experience because I can bring them

18
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,880
back. So you always look at this in a

19
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,280
nice selfish way. I don't mean in a

20
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,520
negative selfish way. In a nice selfish

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,920
way. Somebody went to a tech company. Go

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,360
there. I'm sure the allure of PepsiCo

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,440
will make you want to come back if I

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,760
wanted you back. and now I have somebody

25
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,920
who's got the PepsiCo pedigree, has got

26
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,360
a tech background and now can come back

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,079
and contribute to the company in

28
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,920
profound ways or partner with me. So I'd

29
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,640
look at it that way. But if I felt that

30
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,559
a person did not have much runway in

31
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,680
PepsiCo, I would also tell them very

32
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,840
honestly that they might be viewed as a

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,080
critical professional in PepsiCo. You

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,920
know, they could have a career but not a

35
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,159
fantastic career. And if they got a

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,159
better opportunity somewhere, I would

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,960
provide the reference and I would help

38
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,560
them find something. I think if you

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,520
really care about people develop and

40
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,520
you've got to think that way.
