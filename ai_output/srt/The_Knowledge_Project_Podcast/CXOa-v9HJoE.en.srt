1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,240
How did you go about learning about

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,920
industries you knew nothing about?

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,839
>> It's surprising, you know, for example,

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,200
let's say that I was working in the

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,120
tissue business,

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,519
>> right? Paper tissue. Uh, I would

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,599
actually go to factories. I'd go to

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,560
manufacturing lines. I'd go to R&D

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,199
laboratories, talk to everybody that was

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,000
willing to give me time because

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,880
consultants can't just sit there and

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,439
articulate a point of view or provide

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,559
direction without really understanding

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,160
the details. So my philosophy was zoom

15
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,320
in before you zoom out. M

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,360
>> so in everything I've done I always went

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,520
deep into whatever the business was the

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,000
company was try to understand things

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,320
from the ground level then I'd zoom and

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,760
say what's missing here why is the

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,640
strategic direction in need of a re uh a

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,199
tweak or a reset and I'd go back and say

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,039
if we did reset it how would it sit in

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,199
the front line what changes would we

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,359
have to make then go back out so this

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,320
constant telephoto lens that I had in my

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,200
head is what stood me in goodstead

28
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,720
through my entire life. Zoom in, zoom

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,320
out, zoom in, zoom out.

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,960
>> How did that help you at PepsiCo when

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,400
you were CEO in terms of understanding,

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,799
you know, the right side of the decimal

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,280
place at at the low level and then also,

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,960
you know, 30,000 foot view setting

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,600
strategy for a huge company.

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,080
>> You know, some people say uh CEO should

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,759
be careful not to micromanage. I agree

38
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,640
with you. What I was focused on was

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,479
micro understanding because if you don't

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,520
understand the business down to where

41
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,600
the rubber meets the road you can make

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,520
decisions at the top which are not

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,159
implementable or in the implementation

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,560
the intent of the strategy gets lost. To

45
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,680
me strategy and implementation have to

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,079
go hand in hand. And very often the

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,479
reason operating executives rise to

48
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,200
become CEOs is because the belief is

49
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,600
they know how a strategy has to land in

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,439
the front line. In my case, I didn't

51
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,320
grow up in the operating businesses. I

52
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,439
grew up in strategy, finance, you know,

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,720
corporate operations, not you know P&L.

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,120
So my replacement for having not run a

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,200
P&L was go and learn each business from

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,640
the ground up. So you know whether it

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,560
was Steve Rinman who gave me an

58
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,800
opportunity to learn the right side of

59
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,879
the decimal or whether it was the work I

60
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,480
did with the Fredo distribution system

61
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,959
it was always zoom in learn the business

62
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,280
bottom up and have the humility to tell

63
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,280
people to teach you the business people

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,200
like it when you tell them hey can you

65
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,519
teach me this business you know I'd go

66
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,760
to the R&D laboratories I'd tell them

67
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,800
teach me how the concentrate is made

68
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,560
teach me how the Fredolay uh you know

69
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,800
chip is produced a lace chip or a

70
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,959
Doritos chip. I'd walk the manufacturing

71
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,440
lines, walk the research labs, talk to

72
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,480
people. I spent an enormous amount of

73
00:02:51,440 --> 00:03:00,740
time doing that.
