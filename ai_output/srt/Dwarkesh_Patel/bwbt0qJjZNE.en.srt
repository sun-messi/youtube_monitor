1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,200
In 1988 89 there were all kinds of

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,680
demonstrations in the Eastern block the

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,840
Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,679
they're for political freedoms in the

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,440
Eastern block there for freedom from the

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,599
Soviet Union. And very

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,320
uncharacteristically the Russians didn't

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,119
send tanks. In fact Gorbachev welcomed

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,279
and encouraged reforms in the Eastern

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,439
block both political and economic just

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,439
as he was doing in the Soviet Union.

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,320
This is about the 40th anniversary of

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,480
the founding of East Germany and 70,000

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,360
people demonstrate at leipig and

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,440
November 8th the poll bureau resigns and

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,440
then on the 9th whatever is left of that

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,440
government is issuing new travel

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,680
regulations and you might wonder what's

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,079
travel got to do with it in response to

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,559
a question at a news conference this guy

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,200
Gre Shabovski who was one of the

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,120
remaining communists helping run the

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,039
show he gets asked a question doesn't

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,399
know the answer and so he wings it and

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,480
The question is, when do these travel

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,120
regulations go into effect? And he goes,

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,680
immediately. Well, crowds immediately

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,240
started gathering at the six gates to

29
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,080
the Berlin wall. And at one of them, the

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,760
border guards decided that discretion

31
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,320
was the better part of valor, and they

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,200
opened the gate. And East Germans poured

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,200
into West Berlin.
