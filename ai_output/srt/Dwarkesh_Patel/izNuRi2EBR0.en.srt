1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,360
Around this time is when people are

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,960
finally learning about what actually

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,359
happened during the Stalinist period.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,839
>> Oh yeah.

5
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,120
>> Um so people are optimistic that well we

6
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,480
can sort of have a changing of the guard

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,360
and maybe things will improve but at the

8
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,040
same time they're learning about how

9
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,799
terrible their history actually was. Oh,

10
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,240
I think there was a an understanding it

11
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,760
was uh terrible, but I think there's

12
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,760
this exuberance of thinking it's going

13
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,080
to get much better. And then the

14
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,600
disappointment is equally extreme. And

15
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,240
then there was this feeling that well

16
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,080
the west owes us because how I mean

17
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,160
you're all really rich and you now owe

18
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,399
us to fix everything. And the

19
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,200
counterargument to that is no, you are

20
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,160
enormous migraine. You set back all of

21
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,640
these countries across the globe back in

22
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,200
time with this nonfunctioning communist

23
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,680
model that you pedal around there and

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,239
now you want extra aid. The problem was

25
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,600
I think we wanted to do some of the aid

26
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,120
but they're not going to be receptive to

27
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,199
it. I think that was another conclusion

28
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,559
with the Bush administration is that if

29
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,920
we dumped a lot of money in it would

30
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,399
just go straight into corruption. You

31
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,320
need a legal structure and in order to

32
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,600
place money and they just plain didn't

33
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,399
have it. There's nowhere to put the

34
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,399
money. Living.
