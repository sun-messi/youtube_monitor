1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,760
Thank you for coming. It's a treat to 
be with you and sharing all this stuff. 

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,440
Since we seem to be in a second Cold 
War, maybe it's a good time to revisit  

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,720
the last one to see why it turned out the way 
it did and why the participants in it thought  

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,360
it turned out the way it did.
I'm going to pose the question:  

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,440
why did Russia lose the Cold War?
People have loads of different  

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,960
answers to that question.
This is going to be a tour  

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,280
of the counter-arguments.
I'm going to start with  

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,000
an answer that many Americans have.
It’s a very simple one that's like, "Ronald  

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,200
Reagan single-handedly defeated the Soviet Union." 
That's one possible answer. But then I'm going to  

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,320
give you all kinds of counter-arguments to that.
Some of them are going to be other external  

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,840
explanations of what others 
did to the Soviet Union. 

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,120
Others are internal ones of 
what the Soviet Union did, the  

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,280
cards that it didn't play particularly well.
And then I've got some umbrella explanations. 

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,040
So that's my plan for this evening.
The story that Ronald Reagan did it… Well,  

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,120
here's a picture at the Reagan 
Ranch after the Cold War is over. 

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,360
You see the Gorbachevs and you see the Reagans 
and they seem to be having a grand old time,  

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,720
which suggests there's something 
maybe off with that explanation. 

18
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,600
But anyway, the way the "Ronald Reagan 
did it" school goes is that Ronald Reagan  

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,480
did a massive military buildup and some 
would argue it bankrupted the Soviet Union. 

20
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,440
He was a man of words and deeds.
He made really good speeches that were memorable. 

21
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,320
Here's one before Parliament where he says, 
"The regimes planted by totalitarianism have  

22
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,280
had more than 30 years to establish 
their legitimacy, but none—not one  

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,680
regime—has yet been able to risk free elections.
Regimes planted by bayonets do not take root." 

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,120
And then here he is before 
the Brandenburg Gate, this  

25
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:59,600
is in Berlin, long a symbol of German greatness.
But then it was a locked gate on the Berlin Wall. 

26
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,960
Here's Ronald Reagan: "General 
Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace,  

27
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,560
if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union 
and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization,  

28
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,200
come to this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, open this 
gate. Tear down this wall!" And who can forget  

29
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,000
the "Evil Empire" speech, which he gave to the 
National Association of Evangelicals in Orlando,  

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,760
Florida, and they skipped Disneyland to hear it.
Reagan did a very significant military buildup  

31
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,560
that actually had started under Carter 
when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan,  

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,600
big mistake as we discovered.
He also invested in and deployed  

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,640
missiles in Europe.
He was busy funding  

34
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,640
anti-communist insurgencies and also others who 
didn't like the Soviet Union all over the world. 

35
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,840
He started doing more 
aggressive military patrolling. 

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,960
By the time he's out of office, he was like 
half a dozen ships short of this 600-ship  

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,160
navy or whatever it is he was planning to make.
He was also trying to build a missile shield,  

38
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,800
his Strategic Defense Initiative.
The problem is the Soviets  

39
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,480
tried to match him on this.
If you add up the GNPs of the  

40
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:26,160
United States, NATO allies, and Japan, well, that 
would be seven times larger than the Soviet GNP. 

41
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,960
You've got to be aware of asymmetric strategy.
The CIA thought during the Cold War that  

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,080
perhaps Russia was spending up 
to 20% of its GNP on defense. 

43
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,600
After the Cold War ended, when you 
were getting more accurate statistics,  

44
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,160
it turns out it was at least 40 or 50%.
Some people say it was up to a truly  

45
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,600
economy-busting 70%, if you take into account 
all the infrastructure investments that were  

46
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,320
associated with military things.
If you look during the Cold War,  

47
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,360
the United States was spending less than 8%, 
Germany less than 6%, Japan less than 2%,  

48
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:05,520
and Nazi Germany, which is no piker, 55%.
So you look at all this and it was difficult. 

49
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,680
So I am going to be quoting lots of Russians 
today because they have thought deeply about  

50
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,040
the fate of their country, how life as 
they knew it disappeared, the Soviet  

51
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,560
Union gone, the empire gone.
They thought a lot about it. 

52
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,400
Here is a former Soviet ambassador 
to West Germany, Valentin Falin. 

53
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,360
Here's his take: "Following the American strategy 
of our exhaustion in the arms race, our crisis in  

54
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,800
public health and all the things that have to do 
with standard of living reached a new dimension." 

55
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,520
Then if you add to the arms race of the United 
States the arms race that was going on with  

56
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,560
China on that border, the arms race plunged 
the Soviet economy into a permanent crisis. 

57
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,560
Here you have Georgy Arbatov, who was the 
late Soviet Union's finest expert on the  

58
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,560
United States, or at least the most famous one.
He's looking at the Soviet war in Afghanistan. 

59
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,840
He said, "It is quite clear that the Afghan war 
was most advantageous for the United States. And  

60
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,080
we got our Vietnam." Because the United States 
is busy funding the other side, and it's costly. 

61
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,720
Gorbachev is looking at this, as he's telling 
the Politburo a year after he came into power. 

62
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,640
He said, "Look, the Americans are betting 
precisely on the fact that the Soviet Union  

63
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:37,440
is scared of this SDI, the Strategic 
Defense Initiative, a missile defense. 

64
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,880
That's why they're putting pressure 
on us, to exhaust us." Correct.  

65
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,080
So some would argue that the US victory in the 
arms race guaranteed victory in the Cold War. Go  

66
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,760
Ronnie. That's one explanation. But I'm going to 
give you a tour of the counter-arguments and some  

67
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:02,240
other explanations, starting with Presidents 
Ford, Carter, and the Helsinki Declaration. 

68
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:09,360
After World War II, the Soviets had wanted 
to convene a conference of European states  

69
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,120
to confirm its expanded World War II borders.
And for a long time, nobody was interested. 

70
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,840
The Western Europeans are sick of all the drama.
The United States still doesn't want to show,  

71
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,040
but we go along with our allies, and our allies 
insist on including human rights provisions. 

72
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,920
We think this is crazy because we know the 
Soviets are never going to enforce those things. 

73
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:37,520
But you get the Helsinki Accords that 
have all sorts of human rights provisions. 

74
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:45,200
Well, lo and behold, unbeknownst to anybody, 
dissidents across the Eastern Bloc and human  

75
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,720
rights activists across the West start holding 
the communists to account for the agreements that  

76
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,480
they have signed and start contrasting 
the liberation that communism promises  

77
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:03,680
versus the dictatorship actually delivered.
This human rights movement within the Soviet  

78
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,160
bloc and abroad, took on a life of its own.
Here you have the former director of the CIA  

79
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,600
and former head of the Department of Defense, 
Robert Gates, saying, "The Soviets desperately  

80
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,960
wanted this big conference and it laid the 
foundations for the end of their empire. 

81
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,880
We resisted it for years only to discover years 
later that this conference had yielded benefits  

82
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:37,600
beyond our wildest imagination." Go figure. Here 
is Jimmy Carter with his human rights initiative. 

83
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,920
It was Gorbachev's English language 
translator who said that Carter's  

84
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,960
emphasis on precisely the human rights that 
were denied to Soviets really resonated and  

85
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,760
it made people think that they wanted a 
more democratic, open, liberal society. 

86
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,000
Here's Carter giving a 
graduation address at Notre Dame. 

87
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,400
He said, "We have reaffirmed America's 
commitment to human rights as a fundamental  

88
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,760
tenet of our foreign policy.
What draws us Americans together  

89
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,520
is a belief in human freedom.
We want the world to know that  

90
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:19,040
our nation stands for more than just financial 
prosperity. We're bigger than that." And here  

91
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:25,520
is Eduard Shevardnadze, Gorbachev's foreign 
minister, echoing some of these sentiments. 

92
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,800
He said, "Look, the belief that we are a 
great country is deeply ingrained in me,  

93
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:38,320
but great in what? Territory? Population, 
quantity of arms, people's troubles,  

94
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,040
the individual's lack of rights?
And what do we, who have virtually the highest  

95
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,960
infant mortality rate in the world, take pride in?
It's not easy answering the questions. Who are  

96
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,680
you? Who do you wish to be?
A country which is feared  

97
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,600
or a country which is respected?
A country of power or a country of kindness." 

98
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:05,920
Others agreed that communism was essential 
to the survival of the Soviet Union,  

99
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,000
but it's an undemocratic ideology.
Fundamentally, it's a foundation  

100
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,760
that can't endure forever.
That's the take of Vitaly  

101
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,640
Ignatenko, who's a Russian journalist.
Oleg Grinevsky, who's a Soviet career diplomat,  

102
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,280
is saying, "Look, communist ideology is 
associated above all with the Soviet Union. 

103
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:33,040
Its rejection created a vacuum and 
it determined its ultimate fate." 

104
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,400
Boris Yeltsin, who is Gorbachev's successor, 
said, "Look, no one wants a new Soviet Union." 

105
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:44,000
So some would argue, this counter-argument, that 
human rights clauses of the Helsinki Accords and  

106
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,360
Carter's subsequent human rights campaign 
destroyed communist belief in communism.  

107
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,840
Okay. Another president, another 
counter-argument. Those who are fans  

108
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:01,120
of Richard Nixon would say, "No, no, no, no, no.
It was Richard Nixon who played the China card  

109
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,840
so the United States and China could gang up on 
the Soviet Union and overextend it financially  

110
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,480
to wreck it militarily."
I think the Chinese would  

111
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,200
beg to differ and say, "No, no, no, no.
It was Mao who played the America card." 

112
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,880
Because what's going on in 1969?
There's a border war between  

113
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,000
China and the Soviet Union.
China's gotten its nuclear bomb in '64. 

114
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,640
It no longer has to defer to the Soviet 
Union and starts playing more tough  

115
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,760
on their border disagreements.
So the Soviets are really upset. 

116
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:38,240
They come to the United States and ask us whether 
it would be okay to nuke these people, because  

117
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,840
they think Americans don't like the Chinese .
Well we didn't, but we said, "No, it's not  

118
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,560
okay to nuke those people."
So the Chinese figure it out. 

119
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,000
The one that wants to nuke you 
is your primary adversary, right? 

120
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,160
Up until then… Think about it, 
China and Russia, for them the  

121
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,960
United States was the primary adversary.
Now they're primary adversaries with each other,  

122
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,320
freeing up the United States to decide 
which one it's going to cozy up to. 

123
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,040
And the United States decides it's 
going to cozy up to China. Why?  

124
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,720
Well, Chinese belligerency forces the Soviets.
Not only have they already got a big militarized  

125
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,520
border with Europe, now they're going to do the 
same thing on a very long border with China. 

126
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,520
These are nuclear-armed 
mechanized forces, very expensive. 

127
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,520
Imagine if this country had to have 
such borders with Canada and Mexico. 

128
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:32,080
It would be bankrupting, and we are far 
richer than the Soviet Union was then,  

129
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,680
whenever. It was bankrupting. So some 
would argue that US cooperation with China  

130
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,480
fatally overextended the Soviet Union.
One could take all of these arguments,  

131
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,200
starting with President Nixon all the way through 
Reagan, to make an overarching argument that says,  

132
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,120
"Look, each president opened up opportunities 
for the others who then leveraged them." 

133
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,400
So Nixon plays the China card, which 
others play with increasing dexterity. 

134
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,760
Ford comes in and begins dabbling in human rights.
Carter then comes in and really goes for human  

135
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,560
rights and starts doing a military buildup, 
which then Ronald Reagan really does. 

136
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,240
So that by the time you get to Reagan, he is 
dealing in a position of both ideological and  

137
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,560
military strength vis-à-vis the Soviet Union.
For those who think that US foreign policy was  

138
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,360
not consistent during the Cold War, you're 
not looking at it at the strategic level. 

139
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,160
There were certain different strategies 
going on and how best to achieve it,  

140
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:40,800
but both parties agreed the goals were free 
trade, democracy, containment of communism. 

141
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,280
Those were staples of US foreign policy, 
for both parties, for its duration. 

142
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:50,240
So some would argue that Presidents Nixon 
through Reagan produced the cumulative  

143
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,640
presidential effects to defeat the Soviet Union.
Okay, others would say to forget this great man  

144
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,960
theory of history business, that's really passé.
What really accounted for the outcome of the Cold  

145
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,560
War was this military platform, that's 
Pentagonese for large military systems. 

146
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,000
But anyway, it's a nuclear-powered, 
nuclear-armed submarine. 

147
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,040
They say that this is the item.
The way deterrence theory worked  

148
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,680
during the Cold War, and I believe now as well, 
is that in order to deter the other side, you have  

149
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:31,680
to have a reliable second-strike capability.
So if they thought of lobbing a nuke at you,  

150
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,400
they would be guaranteed that you would 
have the second strike to lob a nuke back. 

151
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,600
Therefore, they're never 
going to lob the first nuke. 

152
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,560
When Jimmy Carter became president, he was a 
graduate of Annapolis and also a submariner. 

153
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,480
The United States began a much more 
aggressive deployment of its fleet  

154
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,600
and that's continued even more so under Reagan. 

155
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,720
We're taking our submarines and we're targeting 
Soviet submarines in their home water bastions. 

156
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,920
So the Soviets are thinking that 
we're going to be able to destroy  

157
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,800
their second-strike capability on our first 
strike and they're having a heart attack. 

158
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,400
So here you have Valery Boldin, a longtime 
aide to Gorbachev, saying, "Look, the most  

159
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,560
powerful strength of the United States is the 
naval fleet and we aren't going to get one,  

160
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,120
or our geography isn't set up to use 
one the way the United States can." 

161
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,440
And then you have Marshal Yazov 
saying, "For the Americans, the main  

162
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,160
means of atomic attack is the fleet."
So then you get Marshal Akhromeyev,  

163
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,600
who's visiting the United States in 1987.
At the end of the Cold War he will kill himself,  

164
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,080
but he's still around in '87.
He's telling his American hosts,  

165
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,480
"You know where our submarines are, but we don't 
know where yours are. It's destabilizing. You,  

166
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,880
you the United States Navy, are the problem." 
Go Navy. And here's his host, Admiral Trost,  

167
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,400
who's going, "Yeah, the inability of the Soviet 
Union to maintain a strong defensive capability  

168
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:04,160
led to the demise of the Soviet Union and to the 
removal of the Soviets as a major threat to us." 

169
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,480
So you can make a perfectly good argument 
to say the Soviet Union could not counter  

170
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,920
technologically or financially the US submarine 
threat to its retaliatory nuclear forces,  

171
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:25,040
so war termination was the only thing it could do.
All of these preceding explanations are navel  

172
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,120
explanations, spelled with an 
‘e’, as in staring at one's own. 

173
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,720
They're all about what the 
United States did or didn't do. 

174
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,120
So let's get beyond the 
half-court tennis of Team America. 

175
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,640
You need to look at the other side of the net.
This is where the Western guru for things  

176
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,680
military, Carl von Clausewitz, 
emphasizes reciprocity in war  

177
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,440
and the interaction of both sides.
You're not going to do well unless  

178
00:15:51,440 --> 00:16:00,080
you consider what the other side is doing.
So I have given you some external explanations  

179
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,680
and I'm going to do the internal ones.
Here is Arnold Toynbee, he's one of  

180
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:10,800
the finest historians of the 20th century.
He wrote a big multi-volume history of the West,  

181
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,520
in which he argues that civilizations 
die from suicide, not by murder. 

182
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,320
So I discussed the murder, what the United 
States tried to do to the Soviet Union. 

183
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,800
Now I'm going to talk about the suicide, 
what the Soviets did to themselves. 

184
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,920
And here is counter-argument number one.
The Soviet Union was an empire, and when that  

185
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,640
collapsed, that meant they lost the Cold War.
During the Cold War, the Korean War and the  

186
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,000
Vietnam War, there was much fear 
in the West of this domino theory. 

187
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,600
The idea is one country falls to communism, 
then the next and next and next and next  

188
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,040
would fall to communism.
Turns out the domino theory  

189
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,040
did not apply to capitalism.
It applied to communism because  

190
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,560
once the democratic contagion hit one 
Warsaw Pact country in Eastern Europe,  

191
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:05,600
it spread to the others until it was a 
seething mess and they fell like dominoes. 

192
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,280
So in 1988-89, there were all kinds 
of demonstrations in the Eastern Bloc,  

193
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,080
the Soviet Union.
In the Soviet Union,  

194
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,200
they're for political freedoms.
In the Eastern Bloc,  

195
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,160
they're for freedom from the Soviet Union.
Gorbachev may not have gotten that detail. 

196
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,280
They're all about not only 
wanting political freedoms,  

197
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,880
but also they're about crumbling economies and 
how to fix their miserable standards of living. 

198
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,400
Very uncharacteristically, the 
Russians didn't send tanks. 

199
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:42,080
In fact, Gorbachev welcomed and encouraged reforms 
in the Eastern Bloc, both political and economic,  

200
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,880
just as he was doing in the Soviet Union.
So his ideas of glasnost, openness,  

201
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:58,240
and perestroika, rebuilding, resonated at home 
and abroad. These reforms began in Poland. Poland  

202
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:07,520
had been a scene of much worker unrest many 
times, in 1956, 1970, 1976, and 1980 and 1981. 

203
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,400
In 1981, this is when Solidarity, the 
workers movement, gets going and it  

204
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:19,200
gets a national and an international reputation.
The next set of strikes are happening in 1988,  

205
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:27,120
because in the preceding several years, the 
Polish standard of living had shrunk by over 3%. 

206
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:34,480
The government was out of cash and wanted to raise 
basic food prices, and Poles hit the streets. 

207
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,080
The government was in a panic, because it was 
worried the economy would go into free fall. 

208
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,760
So the government cut a deal with Solidarity.
They said, "You call off the strikes and then  

209
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,720
we'll let you into political 
talks," and Solidarity agreed. 

210
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,920
There was a complicating factor on all of this.
It's called the Roman Catholic Church,  

211
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:02,080
which is an institution of enormous credibility 
and legitimacy in Poland, which had a partiality  

212
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:10,480
for Solidarity and it had a Polish pope.
So the roundtable discussions  

213
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,760
were these political talks.
They occurred a year later in  

214
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,200
February 1989, and the Soviets encouraged them.
In fact, here's one Soviet person there advising  

215
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,160
the Poles: "Look, you've got to find some quick 
solutions out of your economic and political mess. 

216
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,000
You're an itty-bitty country, so when you 
make mistakes, they'll be itty-bitty mistakes. 

217
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,400
But if we make them, they'll be big." They 
got that one right. The Polish Communist Party  

218
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,320
thought they had this one covered by the way 
they jiggered the election rules. Not quite.  

219
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,720
The day they held elections is exactly 
the same day that Deng Xiaoping turned  

220
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:53,040
the tanks on demonstrators in Beijing and you 
have the Tiananmen Massacre. Two solutions for  

221
00:19:53,040 --> 00:20:02,000
the problem. So the way the elections worked out 
in Poland is that Solidarity won every single seat  

222
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,320
for which it could compete but one.
And then only three people in the  

223
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,960
communist-designated seats actually won.
So who won all the rest of them? 

224
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,360
The box on the ballot called "none of the above."
Yes, the Roman Catholic Church had helped  

225
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:28,080
instruct people that that's the box you want.
With that, the legitimacy of the Communist  

226
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:34,240
Party to rule had just been wrecked 
and we're on to democracy in Poland. 

227
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,480
This democratic contagion then spread 
into East Germany four months later. 

228
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,800
This is about the 40th anniversary 
of the founding of East Germany.  

229
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:49,200
70,000 people demonstrated in Leipzig.
Within the week around like 1.4 million Germans  

230
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,280
are demonstrating in over 200 demonstrations.
Typically, the East Germans would have sent tanks. 

231
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,200
That was what they would have done in the past.
But would-be tank man Erich  

232
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,880
Honecker was already out of a job.
His ruinous policies of living off debt since  

233
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:12,960
he came to power in 1971 had just about wrecked 
East Germany. So he was out. Then less than two  

234
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:19,840
weeks later, the Council of Ministers resigns.
Then on November 8th, the Politburo resigns. 

235
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,280
Then on the 9th, whatever is left of that 
government is issuing new travel regulations. 

236
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,640
You might wonder what travel has got 
to do with it. I'll get there. So  

237
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,640
in response to a question at a news conference, 
this guy, Günter Schabowski, who was one of the  

238
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,800
remaining communists helping run the show, gets 
asked a question and he doesn't know the answer.  

239
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,960
So he wings it. The question is, "When do these 
travel regulations go into effect?" And he goes,  

240
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:54,880
"Immediately." Well, crowds immediately started 
gathering at the six gates to the Berlin Wall. 

241
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,880
At one of them, the border guards decided 
that discretion was the better part of valor,  

242
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,200
and they opened the gate and East 
Germans poured into West Berlin. 

243
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,120
Within the first week alone, over half of 
East Germany's population visited the West. 

244
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,760
Within the month, 1% of the 
population emigrated to the West. 

245
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,680
Like the Polish elections, this opening 
of the gate was a pivotal decision. 

246
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,080
A pivotal decision, whatever it is, means 
there's no going back to the way it was. 

247
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,440
Here's good old Günter going, "Gosh, we 
hadn't a clue that opening the wall was  

248
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:39,120
the beginning of the end of East Germany." 
Okay, better luck next time. And the Russians  

249
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:46,800
were shocked by how unpopular they were.
They were thinking they were going to get credit,  

250
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:54,400
Gorbachev, for Eastern Europe's liberation rather 
than blame for Eastern Europe's enserfment. 

251
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,560
Here you have Yuri Ryzhov, a scientist 
and parliamentarian going, "All of our  

252
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,320
former satellites by compulsion cast off 
from us as fast and as far as possible." 

253
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:10,960
And Anatoly Kovalev, who is a deputy foreign 
minister, said, "Look, we had no confidence  

254
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:18,320
whatsoever concerning whom the East German army 
is going to shoot, the demonstrators or us. 

255
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,680
And the same thing for the Polish and 
Hungarian armies." Great. With allies  

256
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,800
like this, who needs enemies?
The allies kind of cover it. 

257
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:33,920
So this argument says unrest in the empire forced 
the Soviet Union to forfeit the Cold War. Okay,  

258
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,600
I got another counterargument. 
It says, "Nonsense, the real  

259
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,680
problem was that the satellites were unhealthy.
That's why the whole thing fell apart. So this map  

260
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:50,800
is 1960. You see all those tempting green places.
They're about to become independent, and they are  

261
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,680
really sick of their Western European colonizers.
Enter the Soviet Union with a program to put the  

262
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,960
West out of business. There were 
many takers. Fast forward to late  

263
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:08,160
1980s. The Soviet Union is on a roll.
Small hitch, in the late 1970s there  

264
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:14,000
was a big recession that continued into 
the 80s and tanked commodity prices. 

265
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:22,640
For some of the newfound pals like Angola, 
South Yemen, Ethiopia, Nicaragua, it wrecked  

266
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,120
their export earnings because they're exporting 
commodities and these commodity prices are down. 

267
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,040
In many cases, it halved them.
The Soviet Union was really  

268
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:37,200
dependent on oil exports, still is.
Oil prices tanked and oil accounted  

269
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,960
for up to 55% of the Soviet budget.
So here Brezhnev has got a deep bench  

270
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,120
of non-performing piles at a time when he 
doesn't have the money to support all of them. 

271
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,240
Worse yet from the Soviet point of view, 
it's dumped all this money in these Third  

272
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,240
World friends but meanwhile, it's got its 
own nationalities who are deeply unhappy  

273
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,720
and they want out of the empire.
Most problematically, they all  

274
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,080
revolt at exactly the same time.
One of the rules for continental  

275
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,480
empire is "no two-front wars".
Russia has so many fronts at  

276
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,960
this point, it can't even keep count.
The unrest in the internal empire of  

277
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,320
nationalities started as soon as Gorbachev got in.
There were student movements in Kazakhstan and  

278
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,800
Yakutia, opposite ends of things.
By the time you get to 1990,  

279
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:34,480
there are like 76 seething ethnic 
rebellions in different parts of this. 

280
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,560
There was too much going on for 
the Soviet government to handle. 

281
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:44,000
So you could argue that the Soviet Union 
bankrupted itself with the Third World while  

282
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,800
ignoring its own internal Third World 
of nationalities, whose simultaneous  

283
00:25:48,800 --> 00:27:07,600
revolts brought down the Soviet Union.
I got a completely different argument for you. 

284
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,120
If you don't like all of those, I got 
another one for you. It's the economy,  

285
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:18,720
stupid, right? That line. One could argue 
that communism failed as an economic system. 

286
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,600
If you look at growth statistics for 
the Soviet Union, they're pretty good  

287
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,160
post-World War II when they're rebuilding, but 
they really stagnate from the mid-70s onward. 

288
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:37,360
For the decade preceding Gorbachev’s coming 
to power, Soviet growth stats were one to  

289
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:44,880
two percent lower than those of the United States, 
and the compounding effects of that were enormous.  

290
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:54,160
What's going on? Everyone's lying to each other. 
The data that Soviets are using is garbage. 

291
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:02,400
If you're working for a subunit of an enterprise, 
you have to lie about the inventories you have,  

292
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,120
saying you have less than you do, and 
then you have to lie about what you need,  

293
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,920
saying you need more than you do because 
you're worried about getting enough things. 

294
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,840
It's not a market system 
where the price dictates it. 

295
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,240
This is all about the plan.
You've got to enter the right numbers  

296
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,360
and then you get whatever inputs you get from the 
centralized plan. So everyone's lying. They're  

297
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,400
aggregating all the lies. The higher up the food 
chain you aggregate these things, the worse the  

298
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:35,913
data is, so that the Soviet government has no idea 
what the actual value of capital or labor are. 

299
00:28:35,913 --> 00:28:41,040
It has no idea what actual productivity is, and 
no one has any idea what consumer preferences are. 

300
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,800
You're not using markets and prices.
The misallocation of capital and  

301
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:53,280
labor goes unnoticed until it 
metastasizes into a catastrophe. 

302
00:28:53,280 --> 00:29:02,240
To give you a sense of these misallocations, the 
Soviet Union was rotting 20 to 40% of its crops. 

303
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:10,160
It's using scarce hard currency for agricultural 
imports to make up for those crops, a total mess. 

304
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,640
You can look at what happens to 
the economy with oil prices down. 

305
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,720
We're into a spiraling mess, so that from 
when Gorbachev comes in in '85 to when it  

306
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:29,120
hits a trough in Russia in 1998, you see this 
crashing share of world GDP by the Eastern bloc. 

307
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,400
If you look at Soviet statistics on deficits, 
trade balances, debt, they're just soaring,  

308
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:41,360
and then GNP growth goes double-digit negative. 
That's called shrinkage. It's not the normal  

309
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:50,160
thing. Marshall Yazov, here's his take: "We simply 
lack the power of all these wealthy NATO nations. 

310
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:57,040
We had to find an alternative to the arms race."
And here's a foreign service officer,  

311
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,200
Anatoly Adamishin.
He said, "Look, our problems began  

312
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,480
with the departure from isolation.
The main reasons for collapse  

313
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,680
were internal, not external reasons.
The Soviet economy was literally exhausted from  

314
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:19,120
this monstrous arms race, militarism, enemies with 
half the world." That's his take. Gorbachev told  

315
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,840
the Central Committee, "Look, we're encircled not 
by invincible armies, but by superior economies." 

316
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,680
He often told people, "Living this 
way any longer is impossible." 

317
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,920
So you can make a powerful argument that it's 
the Soviet economy that lost the Cold War. 

318
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:43,360
This gentleman, Alexis de Tocqueville, is 
very famous for writing a book about the  

319
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,960
last days of the French monarchy before 
the French Revolution overturned it. 

320
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,960
He also wrote something about Democracy 
in America, both excellent books. 

321
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,720
But this one's from the one about France, where 
Tocqueville observes, "The most dangerous moment  

322
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:05,120
for a bad government is when it begins to reform."
Russians of all political persuasions  

323
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,680
agree on at least one thing.
That is that Gorbachev's role in  

324
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,880
how the Cold War turned out was pivotal, 
that he played a very essential part. 

325
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,280
Gorbachev made his decision based 
on certain false assumptions. 

326
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,480
One of them was the irreversible 
direction of history. 

327
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:29,120
Gorbachev thought of history going always forward 
towards communism, never backwards to capitalism. 

328
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,040
Of course, Eastern Europe took a U-turn, 
went straight back to capitalism. 

329
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:40,000
Here is Leonid Shebarshin, who is a senior 
person in the KGB, their intelligence office. 

330
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,200
He said, "The thought never occurred 
to the government that it's possible  

331
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,560
to withdraw from socialism."
If you think about both communist  

332
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:54,640
theory and how imperialism works in practice, 
usually the mother country is more developed  

333
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:00,240
than whatever all the colonies are, right?
Well, the Soviet Union was an inverted empire. 

334
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:07,280
People in Eastern Europe as a group were more 
well-educated and they were richer than Russians. 

335
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:14,240
It was like a donut empire.
So when the empire went to Eastern Europe,  

336
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,640
Russians could no longer siphon off the wealth 
of these enserfed populations in Eastern Europe,  

337
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,000
which explains why they wanted to leave.
It also suggests why Putin wants them back. 

338
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,240
Another false assumption has to do 
with the sentiments of the neighbors. 

339
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,160
Gorbachev was convinced he was going to 
get credit for liberating Eastern Europe,  

340
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,480
rather than blame as a Russian for 
having enserfed them in the first place. 

341
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:44,160
For Gorbachev, the clock began on his watch.
For other people, no, Stalin's when it began,  

342
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,640
when he started shooting a lot of people.
Here you have Anatoly Chernyaev,  

343
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,960
foreign policy adviser to Gorbachev, saying 
that Gorbachev thought that bringing freedom  

344
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,080
to our Eastern European satellites would 
have them adopt socialism with a human face.  

345
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,760
"He made an enormous mistake because these 
countries brutally turned their back on us." 

346
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,000
Really, if that's brutal, then 
what pray tell was Stalin? 

347
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,320
And then it gets better: "The politics in 
connection with our former friends were  

348
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:21,280
totally unexpected to us." Really? 
You occupy people, you never leave,  

349
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,640
you shoot a lot of people in their 
government, you put in a new government,  

350
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,280
you siphon off a lot of their wealth, and 
you impose a non-performing economic system,  

351
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:34,400
and you wonder why they don't like you. Think 
about the United States. It intervenes all  

352
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,680
around the world in other people's troubles.
It dumps billions in economic aid and even  

353
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,640
leaves and people don't like us.
I don't know why the Russians  

354
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,600
think they're so special.
Another false assumption:  

355
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,760
Gorbachev believed that if the Warsaw Pact, 
the military alliance of the Eastern Bloc,  

356
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,640
disappeared, then NATO would disappear.
He also believed that if the Comecon,  

357
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,320
which is their trading organization, went away, 
then the European Community in those days—it  

358
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,800
becomes the European Union later—would disappear. 
Not quite. It turns out that organizations that  

359
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,680
are coercive versus those that are voluntary, 
they dissolve for different reasons. 

360
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:24,720
And then Gorbachev also assumed that the United 
States would share a continental outlook of not  

361
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,600
wanting strong powers and that the United 
States therefore would not want a unified  

362
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,960
Germany, let alone a strong unified Germany.
So when all the unrest is happening in Germany,  

363
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,640
Gorbachev is off taking a vacation.
Poor life choice, because at that moment,  

364
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:48,160
President George Bush Sr. and Chancellor Kohl 
of Germany are working on fast-tracking German  

365
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:53,360
unification of a fully sovereign, 
unified Germany—both halves in NATO. 

366
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:01,840
So many of Gorbachev's closest supporters 
at the end of it all blamed him. 

367
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:08,960
They said, "Look, his foreign policy mistakes were 
a function of his domestic policy mistakes and it  

368
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,600
destroyed the Soviet Union."
Back to this America expert,  

369
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:21,760
Vladimir Lukin: "Gorbachev was no Deng Xiaoping."
And Arbatov, who's their premier America expert:  

370
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,120
"The stupidity of our leaders caused 
the disintegration of the Soviet Union." 

371
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:33,120
So the big bozo was playing with plastic 
bags, stuck one on his head, committed  

372
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:40,640
suicide. It was by mistake. Lukin continued: 
"In the West, they love Gorbachev because  

373
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:47,680
everything took place so easily and cheaply, 
basically like that, but only for you. For us,  

374
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:55,920
it was expensive." But you could argue the time to 
reassess all the Stalinist stuff was long overdue. 

375
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,480
Here's a completely different 
way of looking at it. 

376
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,960
I've been giving you sins of commission, and now 
I'm going to do sins of omission. It's a good  

377
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,960
framework. It's useful for other things. The sins 
of commission are all the things Gorbachev did. 

378
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,920
Now what I'm going to do 
is what the army didn't do. 

379
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,200
Some would argue that the Red Army 
should have done exactly what Deng  

380
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,160
Xiaoping ordered his army to do.
You just send the tanks against  

381
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,560
civilian demonstrators and they 
truly crush them and it'll be over. 

382
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,080
Communist Party is still in 
power in China 30 years later. 

383
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,520
So there are some people who believe 
that this was a terrible mistake. 

384
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,440
So this argument would be that 
timely tank deployments—TTD,  

385
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,360
my contribution to military acronyms—would 
have changed the outcome of the Cold War. 

386
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,920
Others would be back to the great men 
of history and sins of commission,  

387
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,000
and they wouldn't be picking on Gorbachev 
but his successor Boris Yeltsin. 

388
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:59,280
There are two big pieces of evidence when we look.
He removed Article 6 from the Soviet Constitution,  

389
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:05,200
which guaranteed that the Communist 
Party would always monopolize power. 

390
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,880
And then in addition in the following 
year, Yeltsin's the head of Russia,  

391
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,720
he gets together with the heads of Ukraine and 
Belarus, and they signed the Belavezha Accords,  

392
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,560
which then formally dissolved the Soviet Union.
So according to this way of thinking,  

393
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:28,720
it's his fault. It's suicide on purpose. And 
what it does is it opens the door for multiple  

394
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,560
parties and for the nationalities within 
the Soviet Empire to become independent. 

395
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,160
So I've given you internal explanations. 
I've given you external explanations. Now I'm  

396
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:47,360
going to give you some umbrella explanations.
They're based on all the preceding evidence,  

397
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,560
and they come to opposite conclusions.
The first one was, well,  

398
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:56,560
any of the above, it's inevitable.
The opposite conclusion from the same evidence is  

399
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,960
that no, it took all of the above. The West barely 
won. I'm going to start with "any of the above". 

400
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,480
You could argue with this many serious 
problems, it was a matter of time  

401
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:15,440
before the Soviet Union collapsed.
It was an objectionable system for  

402
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,920
precisely the reasons the West didn't like it.
It had a brutally inefficient economic system. 

403
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,320
Russians who invented the thing, at the 
end of the day, didn't want it either. 

404
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:34,800
By this way of looking at it, you have people like 
Yuri Ryzhov, a genuine rocket scientist, who says,  

405
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,840
"Look, the main reason for the collapse of the 
Soviet Union is the rottenness of its system." 

406
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:45,120
Then here's a journalist, Teimuraz Stepanov, who 
said, "Look, I think from the beginning the genes  

407
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:50,000
of disintegration were contained in the genetics 
of this governmental political formation." 

408
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,680
Don't you love the products of 
the Soviet educational system? 

409
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:59,040
Don't ever use wording like that.
So you could argue that the Soviet Union  

410
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,560
was destined to fail with this many problems.
Others would come to the opposite conclusion. 

411
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:12,320
They would say, "No, it took every single one of 
them for the Cold War to end on Western terms." 

412
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,000
Back to Anatoly Kovalev, the deputy 
foreign minister, he said, "Look,  

413
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
all these factors merge—internal, ideological, 
economic, military—it's all of them. 

414
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,120
You remove any one of them and 
you get a different outcome. 

415
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,640
Maybe the Cold War ends, but it 
might end completely differently." 

416
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:36,400
So by this line of reasoning, the West barely 
won and should feel very fortunate that it did. 

417
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,400
One can take this last argument 
and say it was more than that. 

418
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,440
It also took the confluence in 
office of two very talented leaders:  

419
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:52,480
Helmut Kohl of Germany and George Bush Sr. of 
the United States, not the son who got into  

420
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:58,880
those forever wars, but the dad who didn't.
George Bush Sr. had one of the most amazing  

421
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,520
resumes of any person ever to become president 
of the United States. Just look at him. When he's  

422
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,160
really young, he's a war hero in World War II.
He's a Navy pilot, a dangerous thing to do.  

423
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,760
He did it. Then he comes back and he gets 
his BA at Yale and graduates with honors. 

424
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:23,200
Then he becomes a representative for this district 
in Texas after he's already made himself a  

425
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:29,120
millionaire in the oil business that he started.
Then he became ambassador to the UN,  

426
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,680
followed by US representative to the PRC, 
before we had formal diplomatic relations. 

427
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,080
So he's the guy who's setting that up.
He becomes director of the CIA, and then  

428
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,440
he is Ronald Reagan's understudy 
for eight years as vice president. 

429
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:47,760
He is incredibly fit for the job.
Helmut Kohl is equally fit for the job. 

430
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,280
He is the longest-serving chancellor 
in German history since his illustrious  

431
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,280
predecessor, Otto von Bismarck.
He starts out getting a PhD in  

432
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,560
history and political science.
He also starts out in business,  

433
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:07,520
but then he works for state government, initially 
as a representative, then as a governor. 

434
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,360
He becomes chairman of his political 
party, the Christian Democratic Union,  

435
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,280
for a quarter of a century.
Once he gets in, he decides  

436
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,200
he's going to buy up East Germany one 
tourist at a time. How does that work? East  

437
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:29,760
Germans, it turns out, really like to travel.
West Germans had always been able to travel to  

438
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,280
East Germany, or they long had been able to travel 
to East Germany, but East Germans definitely could  

439
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,960
not easily travel to West Germany. Why? 
Because they have a habit of staying. 

440
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,880
But all of a sudden, East Germany 
eases up on the travel regulations. 

441
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,520
You might ask why, and the answer would be money.
Just like the Poles, the East Germans were deep in  

442
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,920
an economic mess of their own making.
Would-be tank man Erich Honecker,  

443
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:03,680
who got the boot at the very end, well, his 
staying-in-power paradigm that he implements  

444
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:11,280
in 1971 is that he's going to live off debt.
He needs to make certain social benefits  

445
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:19,520
available and consumer benefits available for 
labor stability, to not have labor unrest. 

446
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,000
The way he's going to do that is he's not going 
to do many domestic investments and he's going to  

447
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,920
do a lot of borrowing, particularly from 
West Germany. Well, that's unsustainable  

448
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,760
long-term. By the time you get to the end of 
the Cold War, if he's going to fix that and  

449
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,520
even out the accounts, it would be a 30% 
decline in the East German standard of living. 

450
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,400
So he really needs the pocket 
change from the tourists. 

451
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:51,360
So what Kohl does is a brisk 
business of tourists and things. 

452
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:56,880
What he does in return for the 
easing of travel restrictions,  

453
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,320
he pays East Germany several hundred million  

454
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,320
Deutschmarks extra to allow that to happen.
And then he gets the Hungarians to go along. 

455
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:11,440
He gets the Hungarians to open up their Austrian 
border to let East Germans out that way,  

456
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,440
and he gives them a half a billion 
Deutschmarks for that little favor. 

457
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,120
When Kohl introduces his 10-point unification 
program—because now he's thinking he's going  

458
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:27,120
to get both Germanys together—this is when he 
starts doling out big bucks to the Soviet Union,  

459
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,880
whose economy is unraveling.
Gorbachev is going to be  

460
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:37,360
desperate for this cash as that's happening.
So West Germany provides 100 million in food,  

461
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:41,760
especially in meat, for the Soviet 
Union that doesn't have these things. 

462
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:50,480
Nevertheless, the unrest just keeps on going.
The Berlin Wall, as I've told you, is breached,  

463
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,600
and then you wind up with a West German 
caretaker government, and the financial  

464
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:01,760
situation in Russia itself is unraveling.
By the time you get to January 1990, Bush and Kohl  

465
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,880
get together and they decide they want to really 
fast-track German reunification. Why? Because  

466
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,640
they've got to get it done before this unraveling 
crisis causes Gorbachev to fall from power. 

467
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:20,320
So they have got a game going, the 
two of them. It's complicated. Here's  

468
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:26,720
why. Gorbachev was dead-set against 
Germany, a united Germany, in NATO. 

469
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,920
He's not really keen about a united 
Germany, let alone one in NATO. 

470
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,520
The US State Department experts, the guys 
who know everything, are saying, "No,  

471
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:40,240
you want to go slow on this unification business."
Kohl is also running a coalition government. 

472
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,520
There are people in that government he cannot fire 
because they're from different political parties. 

473
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,600
One of them is his foreign minister, 
this guy Genscher, who is very skeptical  

474
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:54,640
about Germany being part of NATO.
Then it turns out, although Britain  

475
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,960
had talked a good piece during the Cold War, 
it didn't actually want a unified Germany,  

476
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:04,080
nor did France. Why? Because that unified 
Germany would eclipse them economically. 

477
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:09,760
They didn't want that to happen.
So Kohl and Bush divide up the tasks. 

478
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,360
Kohl is going to reassure the Soviet 
Union that Germany is not going to  

479
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,360
be belligerent or do horrible things.
And Kohl is going to work on financial  

480
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,680
unification because the Soviets are 
thinking in terms of military unification. 

481
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,360
You know, where you deploy your troops. 
That determines things. Wrong instrument  

482
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:30,000
of national power, precisely because 
the Soviets didn't understand finance. 

483
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,120
That's why they're in such a mess. Whereas the 
Germans do. What they're going to do is get East  

484
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,360
Germany on the West German Deutschmark, 
and at that point they will control all  

485
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:43,280
the money and they will control decisions.
But the Russians aren't going to see that coming. 

486
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:51,520
Meanwhile, Bush is supposed to work the alliances 
particularly with Britain and France in the West. 

487
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,520
There are all sorts of 
meetings that are coming up. 

488
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:59,520
Bush's job is to delay those meetings for 
as long as possible so German unification  

489
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,440
can proceed as far as possible.
The two of them are doing a tag-team  

490
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,840
diplomacy with Gorbachev that he just can't 
keep up with, given that his own home economy  

491
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:18,160
has got these double-digit shrinkage rates. 
Here's how they go. As the trades get bigger,  

492
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,560
the amount of money you pay Gorbachev gets bigger.
First of all, it's just to get a unified Germany. 

493
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,320
Then it's to get a unified Germany 
with West Germany still in NATO. 

494
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,680
Then it's to get a unified Germany 
with all of Germany in NATO. 

495
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:37,680
So here's how the money goes. Gorbachev agrees 
to German unification. We are no longer paying  

496
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,080
hundreds of millions of Deutschmarks.
We're paying billions of Deutschmarks,  

497
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:48,080
five billion Deutschmarks for that one.
Then Gorbachev agrees that states can choose their  

498
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:56,800
own alliances, i.e. whether or not to join NATO.
The US offers nine assurances, but it's also a  

499
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:03,040
trade agreement that Gorbachev really wants.
Then the economic union goes into effect. 

500
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,680
So we've now done the financial 
reunification of Germany. 

501
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,160
This is when there's a London Declaration 
that's inviting Eastern European countries  

502
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:17,600
to coordinate more closely with NATO.
In return, Gorbachev gets a promise  

503
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:22,720
of a G7 summit meeting that's going to 
fast-track aid to him, which it will do. 

504
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,960
And then Gorbachev agrees 
to German NATO membership. 

505
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,920
At this point, even bigger things are happening.
Germany's going to agree to its border with  

506
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,120
Poland. I'll get there and explain. Germany 
provides 15 billion in Deutschmarks,  

507
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,920
including building all kinds of new apartment 
buildings for repatriated Soviet soldiers who are  

508
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,080
going home. Why are you doing that? Because you 
want those soldiers focused on buying furniture,  

509
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:52,560
not running a military coup. That's what they're 
doing. So the unification happens in mid-September  

510
00:47:52,560 --> 00:48:02,160
1990. Here's the Polish borders. At the end of 
World War II, Stalin moved Poland 200 kilometers  

511
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:08,160
to the west, and it winds up taking a third of 
German territory by the time that's all over. 

512
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:12,560
So the Germans don't really 
want to sign all that away. 

513
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:17,920
In addition, as part of that, there were 12 
million German refugees who were thrown out  

514
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,640
of wherever they were living to send them 
back to Germany, of whom 2 million died. 

515
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:28,160
So this is a big deal and it's in living memory.
Germany agrees to this, that the borders are  

516
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:36,400
done. German-Polish borders are set. Complicating 
factor: a month and a half before this unification  

517
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:42,400
treaty is signed, Saddam Hussein decides he's 
going to invade Kuwait because he's broke. 

518
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:48,880
He's had a long war with Iran, huge debts, many 
owed to Kuwait, which he doesn't want to pay back. 

519
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:55,440
So if you invade them, that solves that problem.
Also, he would take over Kuwait's very rich  

520
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,800
oil fields, and together that would make 
Iraq probably the swing producer of oil. 

521
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:08,000
So he thinks that's a great idea.
Except the Cold War's over actually. 

522
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
The Russians are more than willing 
to cooperate with the United States. 

523
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,320
Gorbachev really needs more money, and he 
is willing to go along with getting Iraq out  

524
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:24,240
of Kuwait, but not with regime change in Iraq.
Because think about it, Iraq is a very important  

525
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,480
debtor state to the Soviet Union.
It owed them between $10–13 billion. 

526
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,440
That's a lot of money for a broke creditor.
But Gorbachev is being extraordinarily  

527
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,880
cooperative with Bush Sr.
He sends Yevgeny Primakov on  

528
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,080
multiple missions to Baghdad.
The first one, Primakov  

529
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:48,960
gets all Russian hostages out of Iraq.
Then on the second trip, he gets all Westerners  

530
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,920
out, Americans included. Third trip, not so 
lucky. He's there for the coalition force bombing. 

531
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:59,200
I don't think he liked that very much.
But imagine that bombing going on if  

532
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,880
there were Western human shields 
going down with every target. 

533
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:09,040
Russia took that card right off the table. Here's 
some of the reasoning. Sergei Tarasenko was an  

534
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:16,640
aide to Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, and they 
understood that the United States was going to  

535
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:25,600
do something about this invasion of Kuwait.
So the Russians thought, "It'll be better  

536
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:31,680
if we force all of this to go through 
the UN, where Russia has a veto power." 

537
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:36,320
He said, "Look, there was a division of roles."
It extends to China, the help that Russia  

538
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,360
provided. "When the Americans 
asked us to work with the Chinese,  

539
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,840
we told the Chinese, 'Think about it.
You're one of the big five with veto power. 

540
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,960
Doesn't it suit your interest to funnel everything 
through the UN where you can put your foot down?'  

541
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:56,000
And the Chinese came around to that idea."
However, the Russians had red lines. 

542
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,280
Here's Anatoly Kovalev again, 
the deputy foreign minister. 

543
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:07,360
The red line is, American troops stay out of Iraq. 
No regime change in Iraq. You do that and you will  

544
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:12,800
tank the termination of the Cold War.
And that would be the goal. 

545
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,560
Here's Kovalev saying, "I advanced the 
basic principle that we must support the  

546
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:26,560
territorial integrity of Iraq. This was our sacred 
position. We must not permit a division of Iraq." 

547
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:31,840
So if you wonder why the ground war 
ended after 100 hours, this is it. 

548
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:42,800
The big thing out there is war termination of the 
Cold War. That's the big thing. Saddam Hussein is  

549
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:52,720
a minor event over there. Sorry, but he was. 
If it had tanked Cold War termination or upset  

550
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,040
the reunification of Germany, France 
and Britain might have been very happy,  

551
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,680
because François Mitterrand, who is the president 
of France, and Margaret Thatcher, prime minister  

552
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:07,680
of Britain, were against German unification.
They knew it would marginalize their own country. 

553
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,160
Germany's going to be a 
bigger economy, which it is. 

554
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:17,520
François Mitterrand eventually found solace 
in expanding the European Community to the  

555
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:23,120
European Union when you're incorporating 
all these Eastern Bloc countries into it. 

556
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:28,960
He plays a really important role in concluding the 
Maastricht Treaty that forms the European Union. 

557
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,280
But Margaret Thatcher just plain lost.
She was just upset about the whole thing. 

558
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,200
She said, "Germany will be the Japan 
of Europe and worse than Japan." 

559
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,000
I guess she hadn't been to Japan lately.
She said, "The Germans will get in peace  

560
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:48,320
what Hitler couldn't get in war."
She wanted to leave Red Army troops  

561
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:53,040
in Germany for the duration.
Imagine if that had been the  

562
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:59,120
case and now dealing with Putin… If he had 
troops in Germany, we would be in trouble. 

563
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:06,560
But Bush and Kohl worked around all of them.
Bush said to Kohl at the end of it, "Look,  

564
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,680
I'm not going to beat my chest 
and dance on the Berlin Wall." 

565
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:16,720
Both of them were very careful never to humiliate 
Gorbachev about the Soviet loss of the Cold War.  

566
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:24,720
Why? Because they knew that if they did that, he 
might fall from power sooner rather than later. 

567
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:31,520
Also, they were afraid that if they did that, the 
hardliners would come to power much more rapidly  

568
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,880
than they actually did.
It was 20 years before  

569
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:42,640
Putin started consolidating his power.
The newly independent countries of Eastern  

570
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:48,160
Europe needed those 20 years to integrate 
militarily, politically, economically with the  

571
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:55,280
West so that the cement could set before you 
got the Russians trying to destabilize them. 

572
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,480
So they bought them 20 years to do this.
But there's a cost to all this. 

573
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:07,200
Bush never got credit for his essential role 
in ending the Cold War on Western terms. 

574
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:15,680
So he was not reelected for a second term.
Anyway, when it came time for Nobel Prizes  

575
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:21,200
and why the Cold War ended, Anatoly Adamishin, 
this Soviet Foreign Service officer, said,  

576
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,680
"Look, it's difficult to deny the Soviet 
Union was the one that ended the Cold War." 

577
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,840
And Edwin Meese, who was a counselor to Reagan 
and also his attorney general, said, "Look,  

578
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:35,200
the Cold War began because of Soviet policies 
and it ended in a sense because of Soviet  

579
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:41,040
policies." The Nobel Prize Committee agreed. 
They awarded the prize to Gorbachev, not to Bush,  

580
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:46,880
for his role in liberating Eastern Europe.
So when you're thinking about this question  

581
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,920
of why Russia lost the Cold War, I 
hope you will come up with a more  

582
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:58,560
complicated answer than, "Well, Ronnie did it."
There are probably other causes at work as well. 

583
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:05,200
Anyway, thank you for your attention.
That's what I have for you this evening. 

584
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,480
Sarah, thank you so much for doing these.
Thank you for having me. That would  

585
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,120
be the more important thing.
There's an interesting question  

586
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:23,920
of why the Soviet Union collapsed when it did.
I think the even more interesting question is  

587
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:29,440
why a system that was so centrally 
planned, monstrously inefficient,  

588
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:36,320
brutal, a colonial land empire, how such a country 
could survive for so long into the 20th century. 

589
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,680
I feel like that's the thing 
that actually needs explanation. 

590
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:45,040
How did this regime last for 74 years?
There are loads of dysfunctional places all over  

591
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:50,480
the planet that have been dysfunctional forever.
You look at well, why are they dysfunctional? 

592
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,880
To me, the answer to that one in a 
way is the example of North Korea. 

593
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,400
Of all countries that should fall, a place 
that has ongoing famines in the 21st century,  

594
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,440
and it used to be the richest 
part of the Korean Peninsula. 

595
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:15,040
These authoritarian regimes are really good 
at maintaining coercive powers. Think about  

596
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:21,120
it. In order to educate someone, it takes 
years as a parent to bring up a little  

597
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:26,000
person and then you get them educated 
and maybe they're an A-list politician. 

598
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,440
It takes seconds to assassinate them.
It's the asymmetry between construction  

599
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:44,800
and destruction. Destruction is so easy. 
Dictatorships are all over the world. 

600
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,320
It's a sad part of the human condition.
They clearly know what they're up to. 

601
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:55,360
In the case of the Soviet Union, there 
were multiple intelligence organizations. 

602
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,560
That's what Stalin was using 
to keep track of everyone. 

603
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:02,800
So you want to monopolize information so that 
you know more information than other people. 

604
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:07,920
And then they have a whole bunch of people who are 
the winners of the nomenklatura, the elites there. 

605
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:13,520
You make sure you pay all of them off. 
I mean think about it. Human societies,  

606
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:18,000
slaves, serfs… We humans have been doing 
these things to each other for a long time. 

607
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,920
So dictatorships can certainly 
sustain themselves for a long time. 

608
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:29,440
But the Soviet Union was special in that by 
the 60s and 70s, they had a GNP that's 60%  

609
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:35,680
of America's, this incredibly dynamic economy.
In the 40s and 50s, they had much higher growth  

610
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,800
rates, so much so that prominent economists like 
Paul Samuelson are saying that by the 90s, based  

611
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:45,760
on what they're seeing at the time, the Soviet 
Union will have a bigger economy than America. 

612
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,160
This is just quite surprising that 
they would have such high growth rates. 

613
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,760
If you just think about how central planning 
works, people are going to tell you how much  

614
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,720
steel you can make and which company gets 
to use the cotton fabric and cement, etc. 

615
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,840
You have hundreds of millions of 
people living under this system. 

616
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:06,000
It's actually quite shocking that 
they actually had notable growth rates  

617
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,120
after World War II for decades on end.
Well, first of all, it's a war economy,  

618
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,560
essentially.
You're putting  

619
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:17,040
all your money into having a big military.
Russians define greatness—this is part of  

620
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,800
it—as being a big power, and its 
a military power with territory. 

621
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,800
Most countries in wartime 
mobilize for the military. 

622
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,160
This country did it in World War II.
All kinds of rationing,  

623
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,920
we're not using market prices.
You're setting different prices,  

624
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,280
giving people ration cards and things.
The thing about the Soviets is  

625
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,200
they kept it forever.
They never got rid of  

626
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:44,480
it. So that's one piece. Another problem 
with the Soviet Union is all of the data. 

627
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,320
So I don't know what data you've 
seen, and I know the data I've seen. 

628
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:54,720
It's hard to know because the Ruble is 
a non-convertible currency and a lot of  

629
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:59,680
things they measured in weight and other things.
Like they're the greatest TV producer in the  

630
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:05,680
world, they said. Why? Because they 
made the heaviest TVs in the world. 

631
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,920
I'm serious, when I was there this was it.
They would spontaneously combust,  

632
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,000
which is not the normal thing a TV should do 
for you, burn down the apartment building. 

633
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:20,800
So they're going to measure their heavy TVs as 
a positive, and the Ruble is non-convertible. 

634
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:27,440
So there was a guy named Murray Feshbach, and I 
can't remember which part of the US government he  

635
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,320
was in, but he was really good at looking at their 
statistics and then adjusting them. But people  

636
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:37,120
didn't know. I gave you the CIA ones.
The CIA, they're not stupid people. 

637
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:42,800
They've got the best data they could find and 
they're coming up with 20% of the Soviet budget  

638
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,480
is probably devoted to the military.
After the Cold War is over,  

639
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,920
they're going, "Whoops, we missed."
It's at least double that and maybe triple. 

640
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,640
So it's really hard to know even 
with the statistics you're getting. 

641
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,880
Certainly what Paul Samuelson had 
wouldn't be accurate. It's just a guess. 

642
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,560
My favorite example of this is that 
there were top-down commands that you  

643
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,800
had to produce a certain amount of steel.
A steel factory would then be incentivized  

644
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:11,120
to make thicker bars of steel rather than 
thinner bars because that would count as  

645
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:16,080
greater production, except a lot of inputs 
actually do require the thinner sheets. 

646
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:22,160
So then the other factories have to thin down 
the steel, but that also counts towards GDP. 

647
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,120
So producing the inefficient steel and 
then cutting it down to size is both  

648
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,680
being double-counted towards GDP.
Oh, and just the whole waste of it. 

649
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:34,320
Like the heavy TVs, they probably have four 
times the inputs that they need to make them  

650
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:40,320
that would be good for other things.
It's this notion that you can actually  

651
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:46,560
plan an economy. Prices are a miracle. 
Good old Adam Smith, the invisible hand. 

652
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:52,000
Prices are the way to go and 
markets, it's more efficient. 

653
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,320
I wonder if one thing that's going on is 
that in the early and mid-20th century,  

654
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:00,000
you have economies which are much 
simpler, at least compared to today. 

655
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,160
So even then, obviously, command and 
control is less workable than capitalism. 

656
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,840
But if you just have heavy industry, 
you need a certain amount of cement,  

657
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:13,280
steel, concrete, fabrics, coal.
That's much more workable than,  

658
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,760
"We've got to centrally command what SaaS 
tools your enterprise is allowed to use." 

659
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,720
Oh, yeah. It's interesting 
on the development thing. 

660
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:24,960
The communists have insisted on heavy industry.
That's the thing that they want. Forget about  

661
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,120
the consumer goods. If you look at the 
countries that really have made it,  

662
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:35,200
like Japan and the Meiji Restoration, they're 
doing a lot of light industry and consumer goods. 

663
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,880
Then they move into heavy, but they've 
already got people on bicycles and they've  

664
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,000
got textiles and other things up and running.
That would also apply to Taiwan and Korea. 

665
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:49,840
They do, by all means, get heavy industry.
But that's not the starter program. 

666
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:56,240
The starter program is basic standard of living.
Again I'm not an economist, but it turns out  

667
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:01,040
if you just look at who's rich and who's 
not, that seems to me a more workable thing. 

668
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:05,120
There's also the fact that the centralized regime 
is building things according to the 30s plan. 

669
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:09,120
And even after post-war reconstruction, they're 
still calling back on these plans from the 30s  

670
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:14,560
that call for heavy industry for a bygone era.
In the 70s, 80s, we had our rust  

671
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:19,280
belt collapse of manufacturing.
People complain about this as, "Look,  

672
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:24,640
the US has this hollowed-out manufacturing base."
But it's much better to have industries which  

673
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:29,280
are left behind so that the whole economy as a 
whole can be more dynamic and move on than the  

674
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,640
Soviet Union where the entire thing became 
a rust belt because they couldn't move on. 

675
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:36,560
It's more exciting than that. Again, 
I'm not an economist, but apparently  

676
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:41,840
they missed the plastics revolution.
I mean think about our own lives. 

677
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:45,680
Now we're finding we have too many 
plastics, but plastics are an incredible  

678
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:50,800
material and they're just missing that.
I remember in Russia trying to figure out  

679
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:55,200
where to get sour cream and was being laughed at 
by Russians because I was so stupid in the store  

680
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,480
that I couldn't find it.
Well, we have little  

681
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,960
plastic tubs with the sour cream.
Back in the late 80s, when I was there,  

682
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,280
you had to bring your glass jar with you so 
you could hand it over the counter so someone  

683
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:13,840
could take a filthy ladle and fill up your jar.
I mean, this is part of not having plastics. 

684
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:18,160
And then they totally missed 
the computer revolution. 

685
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:24,640
This plays into Ronald Reagan 
winning the military race. 

686
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:28,640
We're putting these chips and things 
into our ballistic missiles and they  

687
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:34,160
can't do that. And that's a problem.
Speaking of plastics, I didn't realize  

688
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:40,080
before preparing for this lecture the overwhelming 
role that oil played in first explaining why the  

689
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,960
Soviet Union was able to sustain itself 
for so long and then why it collapsed. 

690
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:50,400
By the late 50s, Soviet growth rates were already 
starting to go down, especially compared to the  

691
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,400
postwar boom that America is experiencing.
In '59, they discovered these massive  

692
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,400
oil fields in Siberia.
And then from 1973 to 1985,  

693
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:04,880
I think, 80% of the Soviet Union's hard 
currency earnings were just from oil. 

694
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,360
They use this because central planning can't 
produce even grain, let alone advanced technology. 

695
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:12,560
They use this to import a bunch of stuff 
to sustain the Red Army, to sustain the  

696
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:18,480
population, to subsidize Eastern Europe.
And then of course, prices collapsed in 1985. 

697
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:26,480
Do you think that if the Siberian reserves weren't 
found in the late 50s, that it's possible that the  

698
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:33,440
Soviet Union would have collapsed 30 years prior?
I don't know, but they wouldn't have been able to  

699
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,880
do all the Africa program and things.
It just would be too expensive. 

700
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:45,600
So certainly it would have been a reduced thing.
It's also the gas reserves they got up in  

701
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,040
like the north central Soviet Union.
I can't remember the places,  

702
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:54,240
but this is the gas that gets pumped to 
Europe because that's the better place. 

703
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:59,120
They make those big investments and 
it takes a while for them to pay off. 

704
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:06,560
That was a big deal because they needed help from 
Western oil companies or whoever does the gas  

705
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:11,600
pipelines, compressors, whatever it is you need.
There was a big to-do about that, about whether  

706
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,480
we should sell the stuff or whether we 
shouldn't sell the stuff. The Europeans  

707
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:19,120
wanted to sell. We were trying not to. 
This was going on under Reagan as well. 

708
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:24,400
But anyway, they had built a lot of it and 
it was essential to their pocket change. 

709
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,040
But then when they got all the 
pocket change, they never saved. 

710
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:34,000
Whatever the oil wealth was, they spent up to the 
max. Doesn't it sound familiar? Governments, you  

711
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:42,480
have money, you spend it. Forget about rainy days.
So after the Soviet Union collapses,  

712
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,440
there was a period when Putin was 
still winning somewhat free elections. 

713
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:52,960
So if you look at why Russia's economy recovers 
and why Putin was so popular in the 2000s,  

714
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:58,640
from 2000 to 2008, oil goes from 
$10 a barrel to $140 a barrel. 

715
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:04,560
This goes to your point about how we give 
credit or blame to political leaders for  

716
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:09,600
often what are just long-run macro trends.
Well, what I didn't cover is that when the Soviet  

717
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:17,840
Union collapses, Soviet living standards, Russian 
living standards, they implode and it's a mess for  

718
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:23,840
20 years. It is just unbelievably difficult. 
Oh, and another piece of the brilliant Soviet  

719
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:29,280
management: in order to maintain control over 
the empire, instead of building things all in one  

720
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:35,360
place, you build some plane parts here, some plane 
parts there, some plane parts all over the empire. 

721
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:39,600
So when the empire goes, great, I've 
got a quarter of a plane, and then  

722
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:43,200
where do I get the other parts?
So all of that fell apart. 

723
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:48,400
When Putin suddenly has a lot of 
money he starts spending it on people,  

724
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:52,880
because initially there's plenty of money.
Russian standards of living do go up. 

725
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,640
So of course they like him, and they 
give him credit for all of that. 

726
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:02,320
But then that runs its course, right?
And then it's less good and then he's more  

727
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:07,120
excited about… Well, it's his mindset anyway.
When you get more money,  

728
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:12,240
you want to get the empire back.
And then Russians also like that, right? 

729
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:17,440
Speaking of the empire, Russia's 
economy just had this terrible period  

730
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:23,360
after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
A lot of the Eastern European satellites  

731
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:26,800
seem to recover in this gangbusters 
way. Obviously, East Germany. But  

732
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:33,920
even Poland today is such a big success story.
What's going wrong with the mainland itself that  

733
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,160
these other countries are able to 
recover from communism much better? 

734
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:40,000
Well, they had always been much 
more connected to Western Europe. 

735
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,440
Czechoslovakia before the war was a full-up highly 
developed country absolutely tied to the West. 

736
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:49,520
Poland, I believe, Copernicus is 
from a place like Poland, right? 

737
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:58,640
It's a center of the Enlightenment.
But when I was using the George Bush Sr. archives,  

738
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,120
it's fascinating.
So it's '88,  

739
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:07,040
'89 when the Soviet Union's imploding.
There's a lot of correspondence between  

740
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:12,720
Eastern European, particularly Polish, leaders 
coming to the Bush administration saying, "Hey,  

741
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:17,440
our banking system, we know it's a mess. 
Our financial system's a mess. We know we  

742
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:23,040
need expertise to help us figure out what 
our legal system is going to look like." 

743
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,000
And Bush is all over that.
I'm sure he farmed them out  

744
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,960
to the private sector who would also be all 
over that, like giving them free consulting. 

745
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:36,960
So as a result, you do have them really 
taking advantage of this 20 years. 

746
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:41,600
At the same time when Bush would have loved 
to have given some of the same advice… There  

747
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,880
were people like Jeffrey Sachs and 
others who went to the Soviet Union,  

748
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:50,240
but it was not remotely the same thing.
This is people throughout Polish society  

749
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:54,320
requesting this advice, not like 
one guy with an office in Moscow. 

750
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:00,160
Basically, the Russians thought they knew 
it all and they thought they understood. 

751
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:04,960
This is all the unknown unknowns, the things 
you don't understand, your blind spots. 

752
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:10,720
Truly, economics is a blind spot for the Soviets.
Because think about it, when the tsars ran the  

753
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:17,040
show, it's like a riff off the Mongol Empire.
You take cuts from people's businesses,  

754
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:21,280
from trade that comes through.
Then it's also about selling basic commodities. 

755
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:26,160
You're not thinking, under the tsars, 
of Russia doing high-end manufacturing. 

756
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:33,040
I mean, I guess Fabergé and some jewelry if you 
want to do that. But really that's not it. It  

757
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:40,160
doesn't have this commercial tradition, being tied 
into this commercial tradition of Western Europe  

758
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:43,520
and all the sea routes for trade.
Then when you get the communists,  

759
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,440
they aren't about that at all.
So there's really a dearth of knowledge. 

760
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:51,440
Think about this country with all the 
little kids selling lemonade, right? 

761
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:56,080
You see them on the streets. They're already 
learning. The kids who are doing newspaper routes,  

762
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:01,200
they're already learning about buying 
things, selling things at a very young age. 

763
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:09,200
We just take this knowledge for granted.
It was just absent in the Soviet Union and  

764
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:12,400
not as much absent in Eastern Europe 
that had been more connected in. 

765
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:19,040
Before we get to the period of Russian collapse, 
let's go back to the end of the Soviet period. 

766
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:26,160
Gorbachev starts instituting these economic 
reforms along with glasnost and perestroika. 

767
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:32,160
But what I find mysterious is that those economic 
reforms not only fail to prevent the stagnation  

768
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,520
that the Soviet Union is experiencing, 
but they in fact make things worse. 

769
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:41,600
You would think that reform, even if it's handled 
badly, would have some sort of positive impact. 

770
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,760
If you do it badly, then it'll 
have a smaller positive impact. 

771
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:48,560
But here it just causes this huge 
hyperinflation, causes all these big problems. 

772
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:55,680
So why did reform have this backwards impact?
There's so much that needs reforming there. 

773
01:11:55,680 --> 01:12:01,760
But part of it, I think, is because he wanted to 
do political reforms. That's what he understands.  

774
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,320
As a human being, that would be the thing that 
he's very familiar with. Think about it. He's an  

775
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:12,240
A-list member of the Communist Party to be the guy 
when they do generational change, he's the one. 

776
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:17,440
So he's obviously very astute at that 
level, but the problem is economics. 

777
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:24,320
He's giving away political power before 
he's fixed the economic problems. 

778
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:30,080
China's conclusion is there is no way 
you're going to touch political power. 

779
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:36,000
They're going to hang onto that and then deal 
with as much of the economics as they're going  

780
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:43,680
to deal with. That’s part of it. But part of it 
is there's no tradition for all of these things. 

781
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,680
Then you go, "Well, how did Russia 
get this way?" It's a very difficult  

782
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:53,680
address. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, 
it's flat, neighbors all invade, and so you  

783
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:59,760
needed a big army in order to defeat them.
A big army is going to want a war economy. 

784
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,120
Historically, you're going to 
want to support a big land force. 

785
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:08,320
I mean this is my take.
Others who are actually  

786
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:12,240
experts on these various periods of Russian 
history can come up with something else. 

787
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:16,480
But I think you're funneling, you're 
channeling your economics into that. 

788
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:21,520
Whereas you're looking at Europe, 
particularly Britain, and it’s merchants. 

789
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:26,640
They have a big aristocracy who are not going to 
dirty themselves with buying and selling stuff,  

790
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:30,480
but there are a tremendous number of very 
rich merchants in Britain that are going  

791
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:34,480
to influence government laws and things, 
which is not going to take place in Russia. 

792
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:38,640
Then what's nice about the Navy 
for Britain is you send them away. 

793
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,800
They're not going to run a coup in the capital 
because they're off on the ship somewhere. 

794
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,920
And there aren't that many of 
them compared to a standing army. 

795
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:53,680
So I suspect, I can't prove this, that this leads 
to different outcomes or contributes to them. 

796
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:59,920
One theory I heard that is complementary to your 
theory is that Gorbachev is instituting reforms  

797
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,520
because he thinks there should be decentralization 
and democratization, but he doesn't  

798
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:09,200
fundamentally believe in the market system.
So he's delegating power to these quasi-firms. 

799
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,960
At the same time, he thinks the price system 
is immoral, private property is immoral. 

800
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:17,760
So they can't intermediate between 
themselves using real prices. 

801
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,920
So then how do these firms intermediate? Well,  

802
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,480
there's corruption. If you can't use actual 
prices and property to figure out who gets what  

803
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:28,880
allocation of scarce resources, you just 
backroom deal, which makes the problem worse. 

804
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,480
Well there's no legal system 
and you need a legal system. 

805
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:36,480
Legal systems take a long time to develop.
So you're telling the Soviet Union, "Okay,  

806
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:46,320
communism is down and now chop chop, we need 
a new legal system." It's not going to happen. 

807
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,960
You were mentioning the problem that 
Eastern European countries especially had,  

808
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:56,160
which is that they're going more and more 
into debt because they're not able to  

809
01:14:56,160 --> 01:15:03,840
produce globally competitive exports.
They have this last-ditch effort that  

810
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,680
"We're going to solve our problems 
with some technological miracle. 

811
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:12,480
We need to get even more over-leveraged.
We'll get some Western machinery or technology,  

812
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,520
and then we'll be able to finally 
produce something that the world wants." 

813
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:22,080
I'm curious up to what point 
this was a plausible hope. 

814
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,480
Through the 80s and even till the 
end of the 80s, they still believed  

815
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:30,400
that Czechoslovakia or East Germany or 
something could catch up with West Europe? 

816
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:34,800
They're desperate. Think about 
it. If you're a communist leader,  

817
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,720
how many other cards are there to play?
You're looking, "Okay, this is the  

818
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,960
only card I got."
And they're doing  

819
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:47,200
other things because of the social unrest.
They want to import food and consumer products  

820
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:53,920
because they've been so neglected.
Then there's another piece,  

821
01:15:53,920 --> 01:16:00,080
which is VCRs, the videos.
All of a sudden, those things came around. 

822
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:07,200
I remember being in the Soviet 
Union, the academic year of 1988-89. 

823
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:15,760
One of my classmates had been an English 
language tutor of this person in Moscow and  

824
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,720
set me up because that was the only 
way to get a good meal once a week. 

825
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:28,000
For a meal, I would talk English for an hour.
What that family wanted more than  

826
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:34,240
anything else was a VCR player.
You could have hard currency and  

827
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:40,320
buy it at the diplomatic store.
So I basically got them a VCR by  

828
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,840
going to the diplomatic thing with 
my very limited foreign currency. 

829
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:49,520
I bought an overpriced VCR for them and got 
all kinds of meals for the rest of the year. 

830
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,000
But it meant that they could all 
of a sudden get Western movies. 

831
01:16:55,280 --> 01:17:01,280
There are things in movies where there'll 
be a picture of a fugitive running by  

832
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:10,480
the fruit section of the Berkeley Bowl.
The Russians would gasp like, "Oh." It's  

833
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:17,520
unbelievable. I think that Raisa Gorbachev, 
Gorbachev's wife, when she came and visited,  

834
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:23,120
she must have realized that a welfare mother on 
food stamps had better buying power than she did  

835
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:28,400
by just being able to have access to Walmart.
I think the elites, as they're traveling… I  

836
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,000
have no statistical data on this, 
but as you travel, it's like I'm  

837
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:40,320
comparing me getting sour cream in a jar.
That was the other thing, counting up all  

838
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:47,440
the things in a Soviet supermarket.
The total was something like 77  

839
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:52,640
items total in this supermarket.
I don't think that compares favorably  

840
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:59,040
to a candy rack as you leave a 7-Eleven.
And when you went by the meat section,  

841
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:06,160
the smell just about knocked you out, rotten 
meat. It was really disgusting. I got really  

842
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:09,360
good at making borscht.
Go to the peasant market,  

843
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:15,040
pay hard currency for bones, because I couldn't 
afford any meat, but I could afford the bones. 

844
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:20,080
Then I would buy… The Russians produce 
really good sugar beets so I got beets. 

845
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:24,400
Then you're starting to get rotten apples over 
the winter, but they at least come from Hungary. 

846
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:27,920
Russians didn't even produce apples 
in those days, but Hungarians did. 

847
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:32,480
The Romanians provided the canned tomatoes, 
and I could do a credible borscht. 

848
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:37,920
But you're talking about Moscow, 
the center of everything. 

849
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:44,640
I remember buying potatoes at the market 
and the rotten spots felt gelatinous. 

850
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:47,760
So you'd have to cut those out.
And then you're wondering how many  

851
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,200
nutrients are in the rest of that potato.
It was a really gross year. 

852
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:59,760
I remember going to the candy store and I 
would buy caramel from Poland or somewhere. 

853
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:03,440
It was like a food item 
because it was actually edible. 

854
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,920
At this point, I bet you were wondering 
why you didn't write a biography of  

855
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:10,960
Napoleon so you could just visit Paris instead.
My brother's comment is, "You're studying Russia  

856
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:18,400
and China, two countries in the breakdown lane."
By the way, the point about the grocery stores  

857
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:25,760
having 74 items is interesting in two ways.
One, central control works much better if you have  

858
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:30,000
a much smaller amount of items to optimize over.
So if things are standardized,  

859
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,520
it can work much better.
And second, to your point about GDP being  

860
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:37,440
hard to compare between the Soviets and the United 
States, how do you compare a rotten tomato or a  

861
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:43,040
rotten potato to the Idaho ones that you can get?
They would have compared it by pound. 

862
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,240
Exactly.
Yeah. 

863
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:48,640
You said you were there in '88 and '89.
So this is before the Berlin Wall has fallen. 

864
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:54,480
I was watching the Tiananmen 
demonstrations on Soviet TV. 

865
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:59,520
The only reason you got that TV coverage 
is because Gorbachev was in Beijing. 

866
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:03,360
So all the press was there.
That's why you have the coverage. 

867
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:08,880
And they stayed on because the students were 
demonstrating and the Chinese closed society  

868
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:14,000
wasn’t aware of the power of television.
Guys, they're going to film you doing all  

869
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:22,160
of this stuff and they will get the film out.
In '88, was the mood… Obviously things are going  

870
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:27,680
terribly, but did people realize that they're 
only two years away, or three years away from the  

871
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:32,400
complete dissolution of the Soviet Union?
No. Maybe the end of the Soviet Union,  

872
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:38,640
but there was such optimism of thinking we're 
finally going to be a full-up democratic country. 

873
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:46,400
It's going to be wonderful, with no sense of the 
work schedules that go into a capitalist economy. 

874
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:52,240
To create the wealth in this country, a lot of 
people are working far more than 40 hours a week,  

875
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:57,040
particularly as they're getting 
started, working enormous hours. 

876
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,760
That was not something that 
was in most people's minds. 

877
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:08,000
Sure, the kids who became the ballerinas in 
the Bolshoi are working long hours to do that. 

878
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:15,040
But as an economy as a whole, they didn't 
understand the source of wealth and had no  

879
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:20,880
inkling of all the things that are missing, 
not least of which is that no one's got the  

880
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:27,520
right education. Great, you got Marx 
memorized. That does you zero good. 

881
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:31,680
So around this time is when people are finally 
learning about what actually happened during the  

882
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,360
Stalinist period.
Oh, yeah. 

883
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,800
So people are optimistic that 
we can have a changing of the  

884
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,040
guard and maybe things will improve.
But at the same time, they're learning  

885
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:45,200
about how terrible their history actually was.
Between these two things… Also at some point  

886
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:48,800
they must realize through the 90s that 
things actually aren't improving. In fact,  

887
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:54,080
they're getting worse. So what is the 
inflection point at which the mood is just... 

888
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:59,440
I don't know, because I wasn't living there.
I was thinking that there would be impending  

889
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:05,600
problems as a Chicken Little American.
The sky is falling, the sky is falling. 

890
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:10,080
Americans always think disaster is coming.
I sort of fit in that crowd. 

891
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:14,000
But I think there was a lot of 
optimism and exuberance thinking,  

892
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,600
"We have the freedom to really understand 
our history and what's happening." 

893
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:26,640
This is for educated people, people with college 
degrees in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Now what's  

894
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:31,440
going on in the rest of the country is 
undoubtedly a different story because  

895
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:40,320
as bad as living in Moscow was, living in the 
countryside was going back in time far further. 

896
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:47,760
So those people weren't living well at all.
And it's going to get really bad for them. 

897
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,720
Okay, so people are learning about 
these things for the first time. 

898
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:55,440
Is the sense that they kind of suspected? I 
mean, people have family. They must have known,  

899
01:22:55,440 --> 01:23:02,800
"My uncle was off in this little mining 
town that he was forced to go to for a  

900
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:07,760
decade right after World War II."
Were they totally shocked or was  

901
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:11,120
there some sense that things were pretty bad 
and now we're just learning the extent of it? 

902
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:15,120
I think there was an understanding it was 
terrible, but I think there's this exuberance  

903
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:21,120
of thinking it's going to get much better.
Then the disappointment is equally extreme. 

904
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:29,040
And then there was this feeling that the West 
owes us because you're all really rich and  

905
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:33,600
you now owe us to fix everything.
The counterargument to that is,  

906
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:38,400
"No you are an enormous migraine.
You set back all of these countries  

907
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:45,440
across the globe in time with this nonfunctioning 
communist model that you peddled around there. 

908
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:52,640
And now you want extra aid."
The problem was that we wanted to do some of the  

909
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:57,280
aid, but they're not going to be receptive to it.
That was another conclusion with the Bush  

910
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:01,360
administration, that if we dumped a lot of money 
in it, it would just go straight into corruption. 

911
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:07,360
You need a legal structure in order to place 
money, and they just plain didn't have it. 

912
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:10,160
That was another thing that was 
worrying the Bush administration. 

913
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:15,120
There's nowhere to put the money.
Speaking of these different countries that  

914
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:20,400
the Soviets and the United States were competing 
for during the Cold War, you had this presentation  

915
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:26,240
where you say Reagan alone didn't do this.
But I wonder if the broader lesson is that  

916
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:31,440
nothing any US president did in terms of 
foreign policy… That was all a sideshow,  

917
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:36,720
this tête-à-tête competition for different Third 
World countries: "We're going to get Brazil, we're  

918
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:43,760
going to get Vietnam, we're going to get Algeria."
That just seems much less significant than the  

919
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:48,000
fact that liberal capitalism was more 
appealing and out-produced communism. 

920
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,920
So even if some country, even if Brazil 
goes communist, this is not going to change  

921
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:58,560
the fundamental playing board here.
If you do not protect the liberal economies  

922
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:06,240
of Europe, you're not going to have anywhere to 
play the liberal economic game, and also Japan. 

923
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:09,840
One of the reasons you feel that liberal 
economies work is you've got economic  

924
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:15,200
miracles going on in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, 
Singapore, and Hong Kong back in the day. 

925
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:20,400
So if you abandon those places...
Also in the Cold War, there was a  

926
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:26,080
tremendous amount of economic growth across 
the world, particularly in the Third World.  

927
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:32,240
Why? Because in the past, if there's a civil 
war, whoever's losing either comes to us or  

928
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:37,120
comes to the Russians and says, "Help us."
So whoever it is helps, and then the other  

929
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:42,320
side feels obliged to help, and then you're 
just destroying wealth ever more rapidly. 

930
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:46,960
The Cold War was anything 
but cold in the Third World. 

931
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:50,080
Tens of millions of people 
died in these conflicts. 

932
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:54,560
So when you end that, all of a sudden 
they can start compounding growth. 

933
01:25:54,560 --> 01:26:00,400
So there is a problem with not 
countering someone who's going  

934
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,600
to impose communist systems all over the place. 

935
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:07,920
Communist systems are really 
good at putting dictators into  

936
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:12,960
power in a civil war situation. It's very 
effective. That's how Mao gets into power. 

937
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:16,640
The problem is, then they win 
the civil war, they're in power,  

938
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:22,000
they annihilate the opposition, but then 
it produces compounding poverty thereafter. 

939
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,560
So there is this conundrum, and I 
genuinely don't know the answer to this. 

940
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:31,360
In order to beat off these communist factions 
and guerrillas, we often through the Cold War  

941
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:37,520
had to support other dictators.
Probably in many cases they were  

942
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,640
better than the communist alternative.
It's just very hard to beat Pol Pot  

943
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:49,520
and Mao in terms of how terrible you can be.
But obviously this was in its own way problematic. 

944
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,680
Even if we didn't have to support 
dictators, we had to alienate countries. 

945
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:57,760
You had this previous lecture that you gave 
on the Indo-Pakistani chapter in history where  

946
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:04,000
we had to alienate India in order to fend off 
against the Soviet Union in this little episode. 

947
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:08,800
I don't know what the solution to this is.
If you think that this theater mattered less, then  

948
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:14,320
you could say we should have just kept our hands 
clean of these different Third World countries. 

949
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:17,520
But to your point, if you want to be able to 
show that these countries are going to experience  

950
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,360
growth under capitalism, then you want them 
to not be under the subjugation of communists. 

951
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,800
But then you have to support 
sometimes objectionable regimes. 

952
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:29,920
I think you had a more optimistic 
generation, ironically, optimistic. 

953
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:35,520
The people who had survived World 
War II, there was a real generosity. 

954
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:48,400
American servicemen and women were welcomed 
all over Europe and they were adored in Europe. 

955
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:55,760
They came back and they were a very 
generous group of people. Others felt  

956
01:27:55,760 --> 01:28:01,680
generous to them. That's when the GI Bill 
just passed saying, "You've saved everyone. 

957
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:06,320
Therefore we're going to give you college 
educations, extend home loans to you." 

958
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:11,360
Not to African Americans, they were 
excluded from this, which is a problem. But  

959
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:20,480
white Americans weren’t. It led to massive 
economic growth where people who'd never had  

960
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:25,600
a college education in their family, they did.
All of a sudden, instead of having really  

961
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:31,600
hard manual labor, this real optimism.
And then it extended to foreign countries. 

962
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:37,520
This is when this country was tremendously 
generous to others, and it worked very well for  

963
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:43,680
us. Think about the Marshall Plan. It looks really 
generous putting all this money into Europe. 

964
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:50,320
We made a fortune off of it, as did Europe.
If you're smart, you're looking for win-wins  

965
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:54,640
of things where you both benefit because 
that'll incentivize the other side to join  

966
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:59,600
in. This is basic strategy. This is one 
of the reasons I've got problems with the  

967
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:04,560
United States' turn to zero-sum approaches where 
"I'm going to get everything, you get nothing. 

968
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:09,040
Then I look so smart when we do the clickbait on 
this moment where I get everything and you get  

969
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:16,480
nothing." It's much smarter. The other piece is 
that a lot of things don't pay off immediately. 

970
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:24,080
George Bush is not reelected president. He 
absolutely deserved to be. Because what he did,  

971
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:29,360
the payoff was huge, ending 
the Cold War on Western terms. 

972
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:32,480
But it doesn't pay off in 
time for the next election. 

973
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:38,560
I think this is where Americans miss it.
You're looking at what someone does on  

974
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:43,120
a given day when the real implications 
are what's going to happen in a decade. 

975
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:48,720
Like on tax policy, if we keep racking up our 
debt, it may get us out of the corner today,  

976
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:56,240
but is it going to back us into a corner later on?
This is where Americans need to think a little  

977
01:29:56,240 --> 01:30:03,440
harder about long-term implications of things.
I thought when you pointed out that it would  

978
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:13,360
cost 60 billion Deutschmarks for West Germany 
to pay Gorbachev to let East Germany join West  

979
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:19,840
Germany. That's a lot of money. But if you 
think about decades and decades of future  

980
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:25,200
growth, it's a huge bargain.
It's a mistake to think about  

981
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:29,360
how expensive things seem at the moment.
It's another huge country that you've turned. 

982
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:34,240
There's a statement that politicians 
think of the next election,  

983
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:39,200
statesmen think of the next generation.
George Bush and Helmut Kohl are statesmen. 

984
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:46,320
They're thinking of the next generation.
The group that fought World War II, many of  

985
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:52,640
US and allied leaders, were statespeople.
They're thinking of the next generation. 

986
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:58,080
Or if you're thinking of where I've 
got Mitterrand, who's negotiating the  

987
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:03,920
Maastricht Treaty about the European Union, 
that is statesperson's work of what's the  

988
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:18,560
next generation. It's important. We need more 
statesmen, statespeople, political leaders. 

989
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:24,640
To try out a different thesis on you, through this 
period the Soviet Union is also trying to buy off  

990
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:28,880
other countries, especially when 
it thinks its economy can grow. 

991
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:35,440
Especially when oil, after the 1973 
oil crisis, oil prices just skyrocket. 

992
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:40,000
This is why some Soviet citizens 
remember the Brezhnev era favorably. 

993
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:47,440
Oil made it possible for the Soviets to not 
only import stuff, but through the Brezhnev  

994
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:51,920
period there's actually a net export of 
resources to Eastern European satellites  

995
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:56,640
rather than the other way around.
That's probably their data. I get it,  

996
01:31:56,640 --> 01:32:00,720
their oil is really subsidized, but 
everything in the Soviet Union that was  

997
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:06,400
worth having came from somewhere else.
The problem is how do you measure it? 

998
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,560
They're just going to measure 
by weight or something else. 

999
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:13,200
It doesn't really capture what they're getting.
The larger question being that, it's not like  

1000
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:16,640
the Soviet Union didn't think of 
doing things like the Marshall Plan. 

1001
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:21,120
Obviously nothing to that extent, but this idea 
that you can win people's favors by providing  

1002
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:27,440
them military aid, providing them foreign aid.
They just didn't have the resources to do it to  

1003
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:30,560
the extent that the US could.
That's true,  

1004
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:37,280
but there's a real coercive piece too.
If you mess with them, it'll be really ugly. 

1005
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:54,800
Here's what I don't understand about 
the arms buildup during the Cold War. 

1006
01:33:55,680 --> 01:34:01,920
The Soviet Union is spending 2% of their GDP 
just on nuclear weapons alone at its peak. 

1007
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:07,520
Arms control advocates will make this quip, 
which is that we've already got enough weapons to  

1008
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:12,720
destroy the world many times over. Why do we need 
more? But that is sort of an interesting question. 

1009
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,840
What was the point of spending so much 
of GDP on the marginal nuclear weapon  

1010
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:20,560
or marginal weapon system?
I don't know the answer,  

1011
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:28,320
but you read the plans about these things 
and you wonder what people are thinking. 

1012
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:33,040
We were trying to develop tactical nukes.
There was only a little trick with that. 

1013
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:37,600
Whoever deployed it would be within 
the blast range of the tactical nuke. 

1014
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:45,200
You're going, "Who develops a weapon like that?" 
Apparently we did. Luckily we didn't deploy it.  

1015
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:53,200
I don't know the answer of why we 
had such massive redundancy in these  

1016
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:59,680
nuclear weapons, why the arsenals were so massive.
I don't know the story on how you maintain these  

1017
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:06,160
things and how long they last.
It doesn't make much more  

1018
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:12,080
sense to me than it does to you.
Another question. Sino-Soviet split,  

1019
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:17,920
this huge diplomatic coup.
The Soviets had to put a million  

1020
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:25,520
soldiers on the Siberian front against China.
They had to spend 2% of GDP just stationing and  

1021
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:31,360
garrisoning this area, which is obviously a lot.
That's often what many countries spend on defense  

1022
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:37,200
as a whole, let alone just along one front.
At the same time, 2% GDP, well if they just  

1023
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:42,400
had one or two more years of extra 
economic growth or faster growth,  

1024
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:49,840
that could make up for this huge diplomatic coup.
Again this goes back to the point of, if some  

1025
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:53,360
domestic policy just caused slightly higher 
economic growth rates, that would make up for the  

1026
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:58,800
biggest diplomatic coup of the entire Cold War.
It goes back to economy first, diplomacy second. 

1027
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:12,080
Firstly, I have real problems with the statistics.
I got a sample size of one, moi. I remember living  

1028
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:18,480
in Moscow. It was so backwards. 
It's just breathtakingly backwards  

1029
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:27,120
in just about every way imaginable.
They got a big fancy subway system that looks  

1030
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:32,800
remarkably retro, and at least it works.
But the consumer goods were so awful,  

1031
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:35,760
the quality was so bad.
You look at the buildings themselves. 

1032
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:40,720
I get it, they make nuclear weapons. Do they 
make anything else? Their cars were a joke,  

1033
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:46,640
their Ladas or whatever they were. It's just 
thing after thing. So you're looking at all  

1034
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:50,720
their stats because that's what they 
are telling you, that we're so great. 

1035
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:55,280
It really is an Emperor Wears No Clothes 
moment that finally the little kid goes,  

1036
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:59,200
"Oh, you're actually naked."
I can give you an example. 

1037
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:04,080
These acquaintances in Moscow were 
talking about hospitals outside of Moscow  

1038
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:09,600
that some of them didn't have running water.
How do you have a hospital without running water? 

1039
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:16,080
I don't even know how that's even conceivable.
Or when their kid had put her hand through a  

1040
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,640
glass door or something.
They wanted to get her  

1041
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:22,240
stitched up because she's bleeding.
She’s not going to die, but she's  

1042
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:25,600
probably bleeding all over the place.
They bring her to one place and, oh,  

1043
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:29,520
they got no thread to do the stitches.
So then they have to go to another place. 

1044
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:33,520
Who runs a country like this?
Alright, you convinced me. BART  

1045
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:39,120
is acceptable. I'll stick here. Subway's not 
a big deal. I don't want to move to Moscow. 

1046
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:47,280
Okay, while the Eastern European satellites 
are trying to leave the Soviet Union, this has  

1047
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:55,680
happened many times through the 20th century.
Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in '68,  

1048
01:37:55,680 --> 01:38:00,480
Poland through Solidarity.
Every previous time there's a  

1049
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:04,640
many-million-person-strong Red Army stationed 
in Eastern Europe left over from World War II,  

1050
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:10,160
which rolls in the tanks and prevents 
these revolutions from taking place. 

1051
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:15,920
So what happens in the late 80s and early 90s?
The Red Army is still there. 

1052
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:19,360
There's still millions of Red Army 
soldiers. They just don't shoot. 

1053
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:22,960
Generational change. The leaders 
don't have the stomach for it anymore. 

1054
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:26,320
I don't know how you'd feel about 
sending tanks and going, "Oh,  

1055
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:31,200
we're going to splatter all these people."
I think for many Americans, that would not  

1056
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:36,800
be the choice that they would make.
So this ruthless generation is gone. 

1057
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:43,600
Another piece is that Gorbachev had traveled 
and I think he had some Czech friends. 

1058
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:49,920
I can't remember all of his lists of friends.
But they'd been horrified by Czechoslovakia in  

1059
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:55,680
1968 as young people watching, as Russian 
young people watching it and thinking,  

1060
01:38:55,680 --> 01:39:02,400
"It's just wrong. We shouldn't be doing this. 
If communism is what it should be, this is not  

1061
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:08,640
what should be happening." This is of their youth. 
Gorbachev and his generation. It's not just him,  

1062
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:14,400
he reflects a whole generation of communists.
They're thinking, "There's got to be another  

1063
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:19,600
way. This is just not right." So 
he thinks he's got his other way. 

1064
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:23,600
It's this exuberance of the reforms and 
things that are happening in Russia. 

1065
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:27,840
There's a tremendous feeling of energy.
He's telling the Poles, "You get at it too. 

1066
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:33,200
We're all going to do this thing."
But it's all the expertise and things  

1067
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:37,840
that he's missing, that he's unaware that 
he's missing, as are all these other people,  

1068
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:41,600
because how could they have it?
They've been living in a command economy. 

1069
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:46,320
This is what I wanted to ask you about.
You had the de Tocqueville quote about  

1070
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:51,520
how revolutions happen when governments start 
to institute some kind of reform. Gorbachev  

1071
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:57,920
is doing perestroika, glasnost. There's 
the conservative reactionary parts of  

1072
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:01,360
the Communist Party, which by the way is 
a phrase I wouldn't expect to have said. 

1073
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:08,480
But they're trying to resist this.
So Gorbachev goes about dismantling the  

1074
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:14,400
party secretariat and instead devolving power 
down to the individual republics. We know what  

1075
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:20,320
happens later. These republics are saying, "Look, 
we want our own country now." But this raises a  

1076
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:27,200
question. If you do inherit a brutal regime, 
and now you say, "I want to do reforms." 

1077
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:32,400
You know this dynamic that de Tocqueville pointed 
out, which is that as soon as you start reforms,  

1078
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:39,040
actually what tends to happen is that you lose 
power, not that people consolidate it under you.  

1079
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,840
What actually should you do? Because you're 
like, "I want to improve people's lives." 

1080
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:44,800
But as soon as you try to do that, 
the whole thing's going to fall apart. 

1081
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:49,200
This is so far above my 
pay grade. I'm a professor.  

1082
01:40:51,120 --> 01:41:01,440
I have trouble justifying a B+ on a paper.
I'm a believer in gradual reforms. Do it  

1083
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:07,360
incrementally. For the Soviet Union, it 
would be gradual legal reforms, work it  

1084
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:17,120
through their Duma slowly, and do it that way.
But seek out help from the European Union that  

1085
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:23,840
has many, many experts that would 
be overjoyed if Putin and friends  

1086
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:31,360
would cease doing their number on Ukraine.
Now the problem is you're going to get into  

1087
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:38,640
reparations for the horrors they've inflicted.
So that ship has sadly sailed for this generation. 

1088
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:48,080
There's no nice ending for Russians. 
It's too late. But you can look at  

1089
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:53,840
Europe itself improving its institutions 
and Ukraine improving its institutions. 

1090
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:59,840
If you think about what forces you to 
change, the existential threat on Ukraine,  

1091
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:04,720
if they survive all this, this is forcing 
them really to clean up their institutions. 

1092
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:11,200
So it's happening rapidly there, but we don't 
know the end of that story, how it ends. 

1093
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:14,640
I do think these are interesting lessons here of 
whenever we look at a country from the outside,  

1094
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:20,480
we have this thing of, "Well, just reform 
everything and just fix your economy." 

1095
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:23,280
Whenever we understand the 
system better… For example,  

1096
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:29,680
in the United States, healthcare is 20% of GDP.
This idea that Trump or Obama or Biden, whoever,  

1097
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:33,120
could just come in and be like, 
"Well, I'll just fix healthcare." 

1098
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:37,200
We recognize that this is a wildly 
implausible thing to happen. 

1099
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:41,200
But then we have this expectation that in Russia, 
Gorbachev or Yeltsin could have just been like,  

1100
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:45,280
"100% of my economy is messed up, 
and I'm just going to fix it." 

1101
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:51,360
American hubris in action. Think about our 
country. We have one of the most crazy tax codes  

1102
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:56,640
on the planet, and neither party can touch it.
Because you touch any part of it,  

1103
01:42:56,640 --> 01:43:02,640
someone negotiated that wording exactly.
Yet think of how much of our economy is  

1104
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:08,000
taken up by the overhead of all the 
tax accountants, all the misdirected  

1105
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:13,840
cash in order to take advantage of something 
that's simply an invention of the tax system. 

1106
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:21,600
There was years ago when there was talk of doing a 
flat tax, "Wouldn't that be much more efficient?" 

1107
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:26,720
You can imagine what accountants thought 
about that one. That idea has totally died.  

1108
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:33,680
Talk about inefficiency. Then we realize 
we have budgetary problems in this country. 

1109
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:39,920
This would seem to be something that ought to 
be on people's radar, clean up the tax code. 

1110
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:45,440
But isn't it precisely that many people 
don't want the radar on the tax code? 

1111
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:50,960
That's why we're wondering who can get in and out 
of girls' or boys' bathrooms, instead of looking  

1112
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:54,080
at the tax code, which should be the real thing.
I think there should be big  

1113
01:43:54,080 --> 01:44:00,640
deductions for podcasts.
It should count for research and development. 

1114
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:07,200
Well, Dwarkesh, you're almost at that stage.
You need to add a lobbyist in DC. 

1115
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:14,240
We'll work on it. There's a very interesting 
book about North Korea, I forget the title,  

1116
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:21,840
where the author is pointing out that 
North Korea could not even start doing  

1117
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:29,200
reforms today because as soon as there was some 
sort of information from the outside world that  

1118
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:33,360
North Koreans could see—which would be part of 
any reform—they would immediately realize that  

1119
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:36,880
everything the government has told them is false.
South Korea is enormously wealthier and they  

1120
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:42,480
have this terrible standard of living.
Obviously, this is the same experience  

1121
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:46,000
that Eastern Europeans had.
Literally in many cases, you had a  

1122
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:51,200
country that was bisected in half and 
the other half is living so much richer. 

1123
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:57,600
In those situations, I guess this goes back to 
the question of, "Well, today in North Korea,  

1124
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,400
how would it even kick off if Kim 
Jong-un just had a change of heart  

1125
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:04,240
or if somebody else came into power?"
They're probably just trapped in this to  

1126
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:07,760
the extent that they want to keep power.
Oh, he's trapped because he's a dead boy  

1127
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:16,720
if he tries to take a go at retirement.
In Asia—I don't know exactly all of the  

1128
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:20,880
parts of Asia where this applies to, 
it's some parts—there's a thought that  

1129
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:26,640
things last for three generations and then 
it's over. So he's the third generation.  

1130
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:33,440
Whether this is true or not doesn't matter.
If you believe it's true, it will become a  

1131
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:39,440
self-fulfilling prophecy. So I'll be interested. 
I probably won't live to see it, you in the  

1132
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:46,320
room will, what happens to the Kim family, 
whether it makes it to generation four or not. 

1133
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:51,760
But by their own belief system, in 
theory, they shouldn't. So who knows? 

1134
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:58,640
One more question about oil.
Based on my big expertise on oil, zero. Okay. 

1135
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:08,080
During this period between '73 and '85, 
when they had these huge oil revenues,  

1136
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:13,600
presumably there was some amount of exuberance.
But did the government recognize and realize that  

1137
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:21,840
they're super fragile to the price of oil 
and if that collapses, they need some sort  

1138
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:27,440
of contingency plan, some rainy day fund?
You must notice that, "Oh, this is half my  

1139
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:31,520
budget, and all of my foreign currency 
is coming from oil, and this is a very  

1140
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:35,200
volatile commodity." Nobody noticed that?
Yeah, well, it's interesting. I was reading  

1141
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:40,960
this long chronology that was put 
together sort of like early Putin. 

1142
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:43,120
So before they really shut 
down all the information. 

1143
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:46,000
It was just a chronology of 
the Cold War, big fat book. 

1144
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,467
Just like someone like me 
to read a book like that. 

1145
01:46:49,467 --> 01:46:52,240
So I'm going date after 
date after date after date. 

1146
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:55,600
It's written by people who are really 
angry about how the Cold War turned out. 

1147
01:46:55,600 --> 01:47:01,920
One of the takeaways from the compilers 
of this thing is they kept criticizing. 

1148
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:08,560
They showed how much for every year 
Russia was making in oil revenues.  

1149
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:14,480
It was huge. But in their analysis it 
was, "And they saved none of it", right? 

1150
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:20,080
There was no sense of investing in something. 
There's something called consumption. There's  

1151
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:27,840
another thing called investment. Going around and 
buying a bunch of Western grain is consumption. 

1152
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:32,160
There's none of this being put in 
anything that's going to yield anything. 

1153
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:36,080
So that was a big criticism 
from the authors of this book. 

1154
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:41,920
To the question you're asking, "No, they 
just milked it while they were there." 

1155
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:44,720
Final question, this is not so 
much a question as an observation. 

1156
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:47,840
I don't know if you have a reaction to this. 

1157
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:57,760
Just look at Russia's history through 
the 20th century: tsarism, communism,  

1158
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:03,120
collectivization, to more than 10% of 
your population dying from World War II,  

1159
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:13,680
then back to Stalin, and then more communism, and 
then the economy collapses again, and then Putin. 

1160
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:18,320
Especially if you look at the satellite states, 
they had all of this happen to them and worse  

1161
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:24,320
because now they're getting invaded. Whereas you 
have other countries. Japan and Germany also had  

1162
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:28,480
tragic histories, but then they recovered.
Maybe it’s just the tragedy of Russia. 

1163
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:31,200
Yeah, you're lucky you're not Russian.
Yeah, exactly. 

1164
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:42,320
No, it is tragic. It is tragic. It started out as 
a difficult address, pre-Industrial Revolution,  

1165
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:47,840
that required certain things to survive.
They were more ruthless than their neighbors.  

1166
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:54,240
They did survive. I mean, in a previous 
lecture, I discussed how they wiped out  

1167
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:59,200
entire princely states and Khanates 
and things, they just wiped them out. 

1168
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:03,680
Then you're using their elites 
because it's a rough neighborhood. 

1169
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:08,320
The problem is if you aren't on the winning side, 
you're going to be on the losing side, right? 

1170
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:14,480
But since the Industrial Revolution, where you 
can do compounded economic growth that comes  

1171
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:21,360
from commerce and trade and industry and things, 
that's the real way to get powerful because power  

1172
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:26,480
becomes a function of your wealth.
That involves having legal systems,  

1173
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:33,200
institutions, and stability.
Russia has found it very difficult  

1174
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:36,880
getting with that program.
It has to do with, I think,  

1175
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:44,240
this very difficult historical legacy of who 
rises to power, and also all the missing things. 

1176
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:51,200
They didn't have the Renaissance, they didn't have 
the Reformation, these fundamental movements that  

1177
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:57,840
were very influential in the West.
So there's a lot of negative space  

1178
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:00,480
of things that didn't happen.
There's all the awful stuff that  

1179
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:06,720
you saw that did happen, but then they're 
missing things. So it's very difficult.  

1180
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:14,080
Then people like Putin can set the clock way 
back because he's killed so many Ukrainians. 

1181
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:21,760
What he's done will take a generation 
at minimum to get to anywhere where  

1182
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:25,920
people are going to be thinking about… 
People will be talking about reparations  

1183
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:30,080
from Russia for quite a while and they're 
poor, they're not going to want to do that. 

1184
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:35,120
I should have thought to end on 
a more optimistic note, but... 

1185
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:40,800
Well, history's ended, okay?
Well, you've outlined the ways in which  

1186
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:44,560
countries can chart a better course for themselves 
and that's where the optimism can come from. 

1187
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:52,000
Actually, I've told a story about the last Cold 
War that stayed cold in the industrialized world,  

1188
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,320
which was a good thing, because 
it could have been nuclear. 

1189
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:58,480
It was tragic in many other parts 
of the world, but at least it stayed  

1190
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:03,280
cold in the industrialized part.
There was a strategy that a very  

1191
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:09,680
thoughtful generation of people, not just 
in the United States but all over the West,  

1192
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:18,320
put together to allow for a non-nuclear landing 
for the Soviet Union when it fell apart. 

1193
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:26,240
From this, you can derive some of the 
strategies that worked for ending it that way. 

1194
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:30,480
These are the kind of strategies 
that we're going to have to use  

1195
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:38,400
in order to navigate the second Cold War.
The other piece about the Cold War is the Soviet  

1196
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:43,520
Union living miserable lives of their own making.
But Americans were actually having a good time. 

1197
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:46,320
They paid taxes, they had to 
pay for all the nuclear weapons. 

1198
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:49,600
But as I recall, people are running 
around in Disneyland, they're doing  

1199
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:55,280
their European trips, they're buying houses.
So actually Americans, people in Western Europe,  

1200
01:51:55,280 --> 01:52:01,280
were living fulfilling lives while they're 
waiting out for others to get with the program. 

1201
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:10,080
If we're going to make it through this second 
one, we need to start cooperating with our allies,  

1202
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:15,120
building institutions, and improving laws.
Don't just burn down the house. 

1203
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:22,400
We will get through this one too, and we will 
live fulfilling lives while we're waiting for  

1204
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:28,240
Putin to come up with something different or 
Xi Jinping to come up with something different. 

1205
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:37,040
But if we blow through our good hand of cards...
You interview all kinds of people  

1206
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:42,560
at the cutting edge of technology.
If we get rid of all of our university funding,  

1207
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:46,880
we aren't going to have the intellectual 
capital on which those businesses are based. 

1208
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:51,040
If we're going to dump all our allies for 
unknown reasons and just alienate them so  

1209
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:58,240
they organize without us… If we're going to just 
throw away entire institutions without thinking  

1210
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:06,160
very carefully about what we're doing… We become 
a cooperative adversary and we will be the bozo  

1211
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:09,280
putting a plastic bag on our own head.
I look at the rhymes here. 

1212
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:14,560
The Soviets had this ancient leadership who just 
couldn't get their act together and they're living  

1213
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:18,960
off of debt instead of thinking creatively.
The rhymes are awful, but we don't  

1214
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:21,200
have to do it that way.
So it is more optimistic,  

1215
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:24,240
but we need to get our house in order.
That's why I'm doing these lectures. 

1216
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:28,960
They're lectures in strategy to give 
you tools on how to come to your own  

1217
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:33,520
decisions. That's your business, not mine.
That is an excellent note to close on. 

1218
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:37,760
Sarah, I want to thank you so much 
for doing this lecture series with us. 

1219
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:43,600
It has been a true education across these six 
lectures, everything from individual wars to the  

1220
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:47,920
strategic and tactical decisions which explain 
them, to the broader lessons for today's world. 

1221
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:51,120
I do interview lots of different 
kinds of people, but from a sort  

1222
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:55,200
of view-per-minute average-adjusted 
basis, I host a Sarah Paine podcast. 

1223
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:58,400
If you just sort by popular, 
Sarah Paine comes up a lot. 

1224
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:04,000
But you've got it backwards. I was 
an unknown academic and then you  

1225
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,040
cold-called me about doing an interview. I said,  

1226
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:13,040
"Sure." Dwarkesh, as a result of all this, 
I'm getting emails from all over the place. 

1227
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:18,560
So let's talk about who's grateful to whom.
Anyway, I'm devoted to your generation.  

1228
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:26,240
Thank you for having me. Thank you for coming and 
being such a warm audience. Really appreciate it.
