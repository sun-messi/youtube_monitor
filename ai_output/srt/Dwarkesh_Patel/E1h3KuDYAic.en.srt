1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,040
There was a period when Putin was still

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,319
winning somewhat free elections. And

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,080
then so if you look at why Russia's

4
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,040
economy recovers and why Putin is so

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,759
popular from 2000 to 2008, oil goes from

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,200
$10 a barrel to $140 a barrel. And this

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,040
goes to your point about we give credit

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,880
or blame political leaders for often

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,880
what are just long run macro trends.

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,119
>> Well, what I didn't cover is when the

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,400
Soviet Union collapses, the Russian

12
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,119
living standards implode and it's a mess

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,359
for 20 years. It is just unbelievably

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,840
difficult. Oh, and another piece of the

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,680
brilliant Soviet management. In order to

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,520
maintain control over the empire,

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,079
instead of building things all in a

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,079
place, you build some plane parts here,

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,399
some plane parts there, some plane parts

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,239
all over the empire. So when the empire

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,840
goes, great, I've got a quarter of a

22
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,840
plane and then you know where do I get

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,520
the other parts? So when Putin suddenly

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,440
has a lot of money and then he starts

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,960
spending it on people because initially

26
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,360
there's plenty of money. Russian

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,960
standard of living do go up and so of

28
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,120
course they like him and they give it

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,600
give him credit for all of that but then

30
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,440
that runs its course right it's his

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,760
mindset anyway when you get more money

32
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,600
you want to get the empire back

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,600
>> and then Russians also like That.
