I personally love that bipolarity. You

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,879
probably also have a MacBook Pro in

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,040
front of you and you have absolutely no

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,719
clue of the power the machine actually

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,679
has and could be used for. Aspiration is

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,760
one, but it's good to have great product

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,640
even though you don't use it at its full

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,680
extent. I don't see any negative to

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,760
that. Anyone should go and get the

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,760
greatest cashmere out there if they

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,480
fancy Kashmir. They probably don't need

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,480
it to stay warm.
