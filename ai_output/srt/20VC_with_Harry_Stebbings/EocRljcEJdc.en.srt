1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,440
Which competitive brand do you think is

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,120
most overrated?

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,559
>> Adidas.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,480
Huh? Why?

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,400
>> They're going too fast. They're doing a

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,559
great job in running and I massively

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,840
appreciate what team have built. I would

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,000
just love that they would with all the

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,920
heritage they have in their backpacks

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,160
and all the cultural relevances and even

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,359
in basketball if they would just go

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,480
slightly slower and just not try to

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,320
recreate samba waves. look at stuff.

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,399
They do an amazing job in so many

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,760
places, but they're already always on to

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,680
the next. Just newness is the driver to

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,239
the business. I don't know their balance

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,360
sheet, but I think they could win more

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,120
consumer back to brand personality. I

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,520
think they could win more consumers

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,680
minds if they would just take it take

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,680
slower.
