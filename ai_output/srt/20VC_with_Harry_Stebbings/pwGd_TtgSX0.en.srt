1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,560
150 pitches from YC companies. I backed

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,840
13. Here are the three that stood out.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,639
Number one, Toriel. Toriel is on a

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,120
mission to end mosquito misery. Not with

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,320
chemicals, not with candles,

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,640
with something far more satisfying.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,880
Drones. I know that's not what you were

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,880
expecting. So, how do these drones work?

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,160
Well, each drone is covered in

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,400
microphones and ultrasonic parking

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,480
sensors that are emitters. [music] And

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,680
once they detect mosquitoes wing

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,640
frequency, the AI locks on and

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,280
intercepts the mosquitoes. Now, if this

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,760
all works out, this could be huge. We

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,760
get our summers back and we potentially

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,760
have an incredibly scalable and

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,360
cost-effective solution to fight

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,680
malaria. Number two, Clicks. Click isn't

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,440
trying to build another SAS front. And

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,120
Christ, we've had enough of them.

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,800
Instead, [music] they are creating the

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,120
first AI back office worker that works

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,360
just like a team member. How does it

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,920
work? [music] Just tell their AI agents

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,799
what tasks you want them to do via email

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,840
or Slack and watch them take over. CRM

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,000
updates, report generation, and data

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,920
entry while [music] adapting to your

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,240
existing software. No integrations, no

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,840
workflow changes needed. Phenomenally

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,759
slick and easy product to integrate.

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,960
[music] Third and finally, baby,

34
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,439
Crunched. Crunched is an AI co-pilot for

35
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,759
Microsoft Excel [music] power users. I'm

36
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,520
talking the uber nerd Microsoft Power

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,920
users with the red button in the middle

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,840
of the Lenovo ThinkPad. So, Crunch

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,920
builds models, edits them, [music]

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,680
checks them for errors. The difference,

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,759
it's built by people who've actually

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,399
lived this pain for years. I'm talking

43
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,720
about McKenzie consultants, not tech

44
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,119
bros in Silicon Valley just guessing,

45
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,626
building pretty products. No, this is

46
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,720
for consultants. This is for bankers.

47
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:59,600
[music] This is for PE investors who

48
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,159
live in spreadsheets, have no soul, and

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,719
their time is money. Crunch gives both

50
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,799
of them back to these poor souls. These

51
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,319
are the three that we back from this YC

52
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,319
batch. [music] Go check them out.
