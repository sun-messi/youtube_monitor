1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,439
What do you think of AI companions?

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,359
>> I think they will be a big thing and

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,879
exist in a big way. Like I would love to

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,240
start the day and like someone that

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,240
understands me and like start and tell

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,080
me what's like relevant to me and open

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,679
the blinds and then like tell me about

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,120
the weather and the sunshine that I'm

9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,199
excited for. Of course, I think the

10
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,960
companion use cases will mention solving

11
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,320
loneliness and in that part I think

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,320
that's one way. Maybe there are like

13
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,359
different ways of engaging people back.

14
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,720
I do think there will be like an

15
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,240
interesting future even if you think

16
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,240
about education where you will have

17
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,000
superpower with learning from AI tutors.

18
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,279
But I think on the flip side of that and

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
I think this will like that's my

20
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,040
personal take. You all have education

21
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,960
good percent of time spent with AI

22
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,200
tutors but explicit percent [music] of

23
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,840
time spent without any technology human

24
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,079
to human. So you can kind of learn that

25
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,079
part too.
