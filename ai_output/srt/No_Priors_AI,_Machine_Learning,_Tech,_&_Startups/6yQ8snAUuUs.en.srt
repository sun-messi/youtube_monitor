1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,040
If you watch a foreign movie in Polish

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,400
language, all the voices, whether it's a

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,480
male [music] voice or a female voice,

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,240
are narrated with one single character.

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,599
So you have like a flat delivery for

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,120
everything in a movie. Like if you grow

7
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,400
up, as soon as you learn English, you

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,840
like switch out and you don't want to

9
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,000
watch content in this way. And it's

10
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,600
crazy that it still happens until today

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
in this [music] way for majority of

12
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,760
content. So combining that and I worked

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,240
with Palunteer, my co-ounder worked at

14
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,920
Google, we knew that that will change in

15
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,599
the future and that all the information

16
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,279
will be available globally. [music] And

17
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,399
the big thing was like instead of having

18
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,559
it just translated, could you have the

19
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,480
original voice, original emotions,

20
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,800
original inonation carried across? So

21
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,559
like imagine having this podcast but say

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,920
people could switch it over to Spanish

23
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,680
and they still hear Sarah, they still

24
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,280
hear Matty and the same voice, the same

25
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,200
delivery. So that was the original

26
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,120
insight and we then started digging

27
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,879
further which is that just so much of

28
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,879
the technology we interact with will

29
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,879
change.
