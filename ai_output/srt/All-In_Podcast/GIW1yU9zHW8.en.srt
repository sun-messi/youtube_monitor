1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,880
All right, everybody. Welcome back to

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,680
your favorite podcast, the number one

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,719
podcast. In fact, in the entire

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,400
universe, the Allin podcast with your

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,519
besties. We're all here. It's the

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,600
original quartet. Everybody loves When

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,600
the Core Four are here. And we have a

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,039
docket for you today, guys. We got to

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,119
start out with Bernie Sanders. I know

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,080
this is becoming a bit repetitive, but

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,000
AI is the topic.

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,800
We reached a new level of retardation

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,559
this week that we cannot avoid. Bernie

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:38,320
Sanders has a major del pitch, a

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,800
moratorum on new AI data centers.

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,640
Here's his argument. Number one, the

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,040
billionaires are pushing AI because they

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,000
want more money and power. Number two,

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,239
there's going to be massive

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,160
unemployment. And he cites Skates,

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:56,079
Staro, Elon, saying that a AI would

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,920
replace most jobs. Number three, he uh

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,600
has an interesting point actually. AI is

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,879
harmful to kids because it decreases

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,559
social interaction. Actually, we kind of

26
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,960
agree with that one, I think, across the

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,040
board. But here's his pitch, Sachs. His

28
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,280
pitch

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,680
>> you want your using these chat box.

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,720
>> No, I've talked to my kids about it.

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,000
>> Okay, we'll get into it.

32
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,439
>> We can get into it, but I've talked to

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,680
them about it. Look, if you actually

34
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,080
look at the data, if you look at what

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,080
kids are doing, it's so much more

36
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,479
interactive and engaging for them to

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,880
talk to their friends on Snap or to

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,439
watch videos on Tik Tok. Those things

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,600
are super engaging. Whereas doing

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,040
research on an AI chatbot is just it's

41
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,400
way less engaging and you see this in

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,479
the data. So, I'm not saying there's not

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,159
an issue there. You want to pay

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,680
attention to the way that these

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,680
technologies are shaping the minds of

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,600
young kids, but I think people get a

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,040
little bit confused. what they're really

48
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,520
talking about is social media and then

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,280
they attribute all the ills of social

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,799
media over to these new AI chat apps and

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,759
they are a little different. You know,

52
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,119
when I when I asked my kids like

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,040
>> how much do you use these things? Are

54
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,200
they addictive? They said no, they're

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,000
more just really useful. It's like

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,280
Google.

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,119
>> It's like there's two

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,719
>> I couldn't do school without it.

59
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,280
>> Yeah, there's two pieces here. One,

60
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,800
using AI to be smarter and to learn

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,360
stuff and ask questions. Absolutely

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,280
fantastic. phenomenal. I think we'll all

63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,720
agree on that. There is, and I don't

64
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,480
know if this is actually what he was

65
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,080
referencing, but there's character AI in

66
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,200
a in a long tale of spicy chats where

67
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,080
people we talked about getting

68
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,920
oneshotted and these parasocial

69
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,360
relationships. That's I think what he's

70
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,080
referring to, but maybe I'm reading it

71
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,599
wrong,

72
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,560
>> but let's get into it here. His pitch is

73
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,360
that we need to slow down so that quote

74
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,519
democracy can catch up and that Congress

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,239
should put a moratorum on new data

76
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,280
centers. That's his solution. He got

77
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:51,360
roasted obviously on social media for

78
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,840
this. It's the most absurd I think

79
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,400
solution to you know what are valid

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,760
concerns. friend of the podro kind of

81
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,519
who represents Silicon Valley. He

82
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,360
I guess supported it a bit and then he

83
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,120
replied to me and says his concerns are

84
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,040
not as acute and that he just wants to

85
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,280
make sure we use renewable energy which

86
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,200
I guess is you know a fine position to

87
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,200
have poly market put up a little uh

88
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,159
market here AI data center moratorium

89
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,560
passed before 2027.

90
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,159
Yeah, we'll see if that comes true or

91
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,480
not. But uh hey Saxs, you are our SGE.

92
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,120
Sachs or SGE, this is your time to

93
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,440
shine.

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,400
You have framed the AI debate as we

95
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,080
can't lose to China. Bernie framed it as

96
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,920
not letting the billionaire class get

97
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,080
more power and money by eliminating

98
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,080
American jobs. And last week on this

99
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,360
very program, Tucker framed it as what

100
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,040
are Americans going to get out of this?

101
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,519
Right? That that was the framing, you

102
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,000
know, as of December of 2025. So here's

103
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,599
your chance, Sax. Why should Americans

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,720
who have some concerns about losing

105
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,879
their jobs care about beating China? Why

106
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,400
should they care about that sex?

107
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,799
>> Why should they care about beating

108
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,400
China? Because AI is a profound

109
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,720
technology. It's going to have huge

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,080
economic and national security

111
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,879
implications. And the thing that Bernie

112
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,200
gets wrong is that he can't stop the

113
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,799
progress. I mean, he can't stop China

114
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,320
from making progress. We can stop

115
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,000
progress in the US, but it's not going

116
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,840
to stop China from advancing these

117
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,160
technologies. A lot of this is just

118
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,520
math. And just because we stopped

119
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,680
doesn't mean China's going to stop. So,

120
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,919
this would be the biggest own goal ever

121
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,080
if we took our leadership in the AI race

122
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,400
and just handed it to China. But look, I

123
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,040
appreciate Bernie's honesty in a way

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,960
because he is actually telling the truth

125
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,120
about what he wants. And I remember just

126
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,960
a week ago when President Trump signed

127
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,600
an executive order to advance a national

128
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,960
AI framework, a lot of critics and a lot

129
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,880
of Democrats were saying this was a

130
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,520
violation of states rights and we need

131
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,280
to support the states and regulating AI.

132
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,440
And here Bernie is acknowledging that

133
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,120
this is not about states rights because

134
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,880
he's saying that there needs to be a

135
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,720
moratorium on new data centers even if

136
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,040
the states want them. So he doesn't

137
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,759
support states rights either. He just

138
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,360
wants all the progress to stop. And I

139
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,000
think this is really the truth of the

140
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,800
matter is that all this talk about

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,560
states rights or affordability, it's all

142
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,160
a red hearing. And what's really going

143
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,000
on is there's a large and growing

144
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,479
contingent of people who just want all

145
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,080
the progress to stop. But again, we

146
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,479
can't stop China from making progress.

147
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,320
So all they would be doing is seeding

148
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,000
leadership of this AI race to China.

149
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,320
What people like Bernie really want is

150
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,240
they want the US to become like Europe.

151
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,759
You know, Europe has half the share of

152
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,160
global GDP that they had 30 years ago.

153
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,000
And that's because of their hostility

154
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,400
towards innovation and technological

155
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,479
progress. And that's kind of where

156
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,560
Bernie wants us to be is he wants us to

157
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,240
go down the the path of Europe. And the

158
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,039
reason he says is because, god forbid

159
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,720
someone gets rich. Well, look,

160
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,320
capitalism sometimes results in the

161
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,280
unequal distribution of wealth, but

162
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,840
socialism always results in the equal

163
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,240
distribution of poverty and misery. And

164
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,160
if the US stops developing AI, if we

165
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,280
hand this leadership to other countries,

166
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,080
it'll make the United States poor, it'll

167
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,520
make the American people poor, and it

168
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,880
will seed our leadership globally. We

169
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,080
will not be the pre-minent power in the

170
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,560
world anymore.

171
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,919
>> Okay.

172
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,160
>> So, I'll stop there.

173
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,960
>> No, no, it's great. Thank you. SGE David

174
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,240
Saxsberg,

175
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,360
there seems to be a couple of

176
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,880
conversations. Unfortunately, we weren't

177
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,360
here last week, but we had a really nice

178
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,479
uh visit from our pal Tucker, and we

179
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,840
talked about this. He seemed to think

180
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,360
there was a bit of a communication

181
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,960
problem with selling to the public the

182
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,720
value of these technologies. Do you

183
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,720
agree with that? And what do you think's

184
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,759
going on here in terms of the cross

185
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,240
conversations? One group wants to del,

186
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,880
has some concerns, environmental,

187
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,440
you know, job displacement, etc.

188
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,240
And then there is there an issue where

189
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,080
the China beating China doesn't resonate

190
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,160
with the American populace? You've been

191
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,000
harping on about the rise of socialism

192
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,120
for four plus years on this very

193
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,280
podcast. So from where you sit, what's

194
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,400
the actual disconnect in these multiple

195
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,080
conversations that are going on

196
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,800
concurrently and and seemingly coming to

197
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,880
a head here at the end of 2025? Well, if

198
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,520
you ask any of the politicians that are

199
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,919
making these proclamations about the

200
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,440
quote tech barons and try and actually

201
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,680
talk to them about what is the AI

202
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,680
technology delivering, what is it not

203
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,199
delivering, you kind of typically hit a

204
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,960
wall pretty quickly. It's very hard for

205
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,160
folks to articulate what is actually

206
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,759
happening. There's a tremendous amount

207
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,639
of capital being put at risk against

208
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,639
infrastructure to build out the capacity

209
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,639
for many companies, the entire economy,

210
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,880
the entire industry to deliver AI tools.

211
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,919
There isn't an aggregation

212
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,240
at this stage of value creation with the

213
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,560
exception of Nvidia which has really got

214
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,520
this $3 trillion market cap creation

215
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,039
that's happened in the last couple

216
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,160
years. Peter Teal said this best. He's

217
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,319
like look at all the money that's going

218
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,000
into AI. There's really only one company

219
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,919
that's making any money and that's

220
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,280
Nvidia. Like at this point the juryy's

221
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,560
still out. We don't even know what AI

222
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,319
is. It's sort of like when the internet

223
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,759
was happening. You know, everyone

224
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,879
thought these fiber optic switch

225
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,879
companies were going to make all the

226
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,479
money. Turns out that was wrong. It was

227
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,759
the end applications that made all the

228
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,800
money and they competed in many

229
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,039
different markets from Google to Amazon

230
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,120
to Uber. You can go down the list of all

231
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,560
the beneficiaries of the core

232
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,080
infrastructure technology of the

233
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,919
internet that was built out. So what is

234
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,039
really going on? Well, AI is the new

235
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:26,000
lightning rod for fear and for

236
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,240
divisiveness that ultimately breeds

237
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,080
compliance and control, which is where

238
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,840
these politicians are trying to drive

239
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,440
the the populace and the voting

240
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,719
conditions in the United States. And

241
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,880
that's what's going on right now.

242
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,320
There's a lot of fear about, oh, putting

243
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,200
this data center in my town is going to

244
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,039
do X or Y or Z with no real conversation

245
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,800
about the truth of that matter. There's

246
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,040
a lot of fear about wealth creation

247
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,640
being aggregated in the hand of a few

248
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,360
when, as we saw with the internet, it

249
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,080
benefited the many. And that fear

250
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,720
mongering is a very similar tactic that

251
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,320
we've seen in the prior generations

252
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:03,600
where policies were misstated, fear was

253
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,120
used, and then voting control allowed

254
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,480
folks to come to power that were looking

255
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,680
for power. So I think it's just the

256
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,600
lightning rod at the moment.

257
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,279
>> Okay, Jim, what's your take on this big

258
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,959
picture? What's going on here?

259
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,399
>> I think it's important to understand

260
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,720
that politicians have an incredible

261
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,640
sense of self-preservation.

262
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,800
So the question is why would Bernie

263
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,920
Sanders think he would not look totally

264
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,720
foolish in putting that video out? And

265
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,880
the reason it went viral is not because

266
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,959
it sounded so crazy. It was that to some

267
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,000
faction and percentage of people it

268
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,000
sounded rational and reasonable.

269
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,360
And the problem that highlights is that

270
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,839
we have a huge perception issue in AI.

271
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,000
We have a handful of companies.

272
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,839
All the PR that you see from those

273
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,839
handful of companies is a bunch of

274
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,279
circular deal making. It's a bunch of

275
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,560
capital that flows from one to the

276
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,320
other. It causes these stocks to go up

277
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,120
of which a small percentage of people

278
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,360
benefit. And at the tail end of it, it's

279
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,920
accompanied by a completely different

280
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,440
set of articles that everybody also

281
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,360
reads

282
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,440
about the sort of damocles that's about

283
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,600
to fall on their head. whether it's

284
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,680
electricity prices or whether it's their

285
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,360
jobs or whether it's the jobs of their

286
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,839
children or the quality of their

287
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,800
education. So we have a big perception

288
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,880
problem. So the question at hand is how

289
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,680
do we fix it? How do we get back to the

290
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,920
place where a video talking about

291
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,440
stopping all progress would seem as

292
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,200
laughable as it should be? And I think

293
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,040
you can go back to the guilded age and

294
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,920
you can ask the question, how did the

295
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:44,320
industrialist leaders of that era

296
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:47,040
respond through that 1880 to 1920 age of

297
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,519
industrialization when you had all of

298
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,399
this technological upheaval accompanied

299
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,680
by a handful of people with incredible

300
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,240
success, right? Andrew Carnegie, John D.

301
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,480
Rockefeller, Henry Ford. What did they

302
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,320
do? And I think the lesson we can borrow

303
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,800
from them is we now need to be on the

304
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,160
forward foot as an industry. Enough of

305
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,160
the stupid haircuts, dumb watches, ugly

306
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,000
clothes, ostentatious displays of

307
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,480
wealth. We've all done it. I've been

308
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,480
guilty of it. It has to stop. Absolutely

309
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,240
stop. And instead, we need to start to

310
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,800
use a percentage of the balance sheets

311
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,640
of these companies in order to benefit

312
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,519
as many Americans as possible. That is

313
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,600
the absolute minimum. Andrew Carnegie

314
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:32,720
built 2500 libraries.

315
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,040
The idea was as he built the railroads,

316
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,440
you're going to scale GDP. You're going

317
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,360
to scale education and knowledge. Those

318
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,839
libraries are artifacts that allowed

319
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,680
people to feel a dividend from that

320
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,200
industrial revolution. John D.

321
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,959
Rockefeller took all of his wealth and

322
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,240
invested in institutions and

323
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,000
universities. Henry Ford specifically

324
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,000
focused on wages. We need to

325
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,680
self-organize better and we need to be

326
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,279
more on the forward foot. We need to

327
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,279
start doing things that are practically

328
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,720
measurable by tens of millions of

329
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,200
American citizens. And it starts to beat

330
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,120
back the perception problem that we have

331
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,360
because Sax pointed out last week, the

332
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,440
data does not support the misperception.

333
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,959
But the problem is, and Sax and I were

334
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,760
talking about this last week, the

335
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,839
misperception is gaining steam. And so I

336
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,800
think we need to use these tools that we

337
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,680
have to provide some more practical

338
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,360
benefits that every man, woman, and

339
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,959
child can feel. Otherwise, this thing is

340
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,480
going to build and you'll see crazier

341
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,519
and crazier versions of this Bernie

342
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,959
Sanders video.

343
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,839
>> All right. I think it's well said and

344
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,480
you know, as I said last week, I think

345
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,959
beating China does not matter to the

346
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,440
average American. It's below their line,

347
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:46,240
Jimoth. Uh I think in many ways what

348
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,480
they care about is jobs. They care about

349
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,839
their kids getting jobs and yeah, they

350
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,440
care about costs. They care about

351
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,959
inflation. They care about energy costs

352
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,920
going up. Our industry has done a

353
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,320
terrible job of explaining how this

354
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,680
benefits the average American. And

355
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,839
they're seeing all these headlines

356
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,079
about, as you mentioned, all the cross

357
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,680
deal booking and all these stocks going

358
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,240
up. Half the country doesn't own stocks,

359
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,880
so they're not participating in it. And

360
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,639
they're not blind to seeing self-driving

361
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,480
cars or seeing their kids having a hard

362
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,720
time getting a job. and they're hearing

363
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,800
everybody talk about job displacement

364
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,519
and that's a valid concern. People are

365
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,440
scared and our industry is scaring them

366
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,000
I think by not meeting them where they

367
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,040
are and then beating China respectfully

368
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,120
is important sachs super important. I

369
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,920
can intellectually agree with you on

370
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,160
that.

371
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,800
>> But if you lose your job and your kids

372
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,360
can't get a job that's that's

373
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,360
existential. Yes. It's not

374
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,279
>> my child needs a job next year. They're

375
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,519
graduating from school with $100,000 in

376
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,880
debt and my energy bills going up and my

377
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,800
grocery bills are going up and they

378
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,600
haven't come down. That's what Americans

379
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,360
are experiencing. And yeah, maybe giving

380
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,440
uh I think you also made an interesting

381
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,760
point there too about the libraries.

382
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,680
>> The war with China is existential

383
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,639
because if we can keep it on the

384
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,639
battlefield of AI and intellectual and

385
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,639
economic prowess, we have a very good

386
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,160
chance of winning. If it devolves and

387
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,240
all of a sudden becomes a different kind

388
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,760
of battle, that's bad for everybody,

389
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,240
especially our children and our

390
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,199
children's children. So, we need to win

391
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,560
the current game on the field. But in

392
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,639
order to do that, we need to change

393
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,600
these misperceptions. We need to start

394
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,760
showing tactical artifacts that show

395
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,680
that this is a dividend that can benefit

396
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,440
everybody. And we need to start now. I'm

397
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,360
just putting it out there. We have so

398
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,920
much cash on the balance sheets of these

399
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,079
companies. Wall Street values it at

400
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,600
zero. If you look at the enterprise

401
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,839
value of any of these companies and you

402
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,160
do a sum of the parts, nobody cares

403
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,920
about that cash. So, we need to start

404
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,279
using that cash more effectively.

405
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,800
>> What's the equivalent of the library

406
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,760
metaphor here for you, Jamath? Do you

407
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,160
have any ideas?

408
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,920
>> I'm not going to frontr run

409
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,000
what's being worked on except to say

410
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,600
that the leaders of these companies have

411
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,600
gotten the message. They are working on

412
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,920
a whole host of solutions. And again,

413
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,720
we're fighting misperception, which is a

414
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,160
complicated battle, but it's winnable

415
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,279
and I think you're going to start to see

416
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,880
stuff in the new year.

417
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,120
>> Yeah, I would say education is at the

418
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,959
top of that list. Saxs, your thoughts

419
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,560
here as we wrap on this first topic.

420
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,959
>> I'm not sure whether to address the

421
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,839
particular hoaxes or the fact that there

422
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:23,120
are there's a larger effort here to try

423
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,680
and discredit AI and get AI development

424
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,880
to stop entirely.

425
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,920
Let's talk about some of these

426
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,360
particular hoaxes. So on the job loss

427
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,120
claim, I feel like I do this every week

428
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,320
now, but there's a new study from

429
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,560
Vanguard where they analyze job growth

430
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,800
and wage growth in occupations that are

431
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,639
highly exposed to AI automation versus

432
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,240
all occupations.

433
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,839
And they find that both job growth and

434
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:55,600
wage growth is higher, not lower, in the

435
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:58,639
occupations that are exposed to AI. So

436
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,680
if you look at job growth in occupations

437
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:05,120
exposed to AI, it's 1.7% compared to

438
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:09,279
0.8% for other. For wage growth, it's

439
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,720
3.8% versus 0.7% for other. So what you

440
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,399
see here is something maybe it's

441
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,560
counterintuitive, but it makes sense to

442
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,959
me, which is as you make workers more

443
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,800
productive, the value of their labor

444
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,880
increases, not decreases, and they end

445
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,360
up getting paid more, and you want to

446
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,959
hire more of them. So this is a huge

447
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,279
narrative violation. And again, this is

448
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,959
coming from Vanguard and it's showing

449
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:33,839
that AI productivity is good for

450
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:36,639
workers. This follows on the heels of

451
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,199
that study from Yale Budget Lab, which I

452
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,040
talked about in a previous show that it

453
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,680
said there's no discernable disruption

454
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,480
to the job market based on 33 months of

455
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,639
data after the launch of chat GPT. Now,

456
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,560
I understand that you can make

457
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,320
predictions as to the future that this

458
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,040
state's going to change, that there will

459
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,040
be AI job loss, but what I'm saying is

460
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,199
that if you look at the data so far,

461
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,519
there is no AI job loss. Quite the

462
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:05,600
opposite. It's job growth and job gains.

463
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,679
By the way, we have a 2% tailwind to GDP

464
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,240
growth right now. That's coming from

465
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,439
this AI boom, this capex boom that's

466
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,919
happening. And so, this is, I think, a

467
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,760
very good thing for the US economy. Now,

468
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,039
why do people want to sabotage it?

469
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,240
There's a really interesting article in

470
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:24,640
Semaphore recently that described how AI

471
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,959
critics were funding journalism

472
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,400
fellowships at major publications like

473
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,880
NBC News, Bloomberg, Time, The Verge, LA

474
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,240
Times, which by the way, I mean, I track

475
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,880
these things. They're relentlessly

476
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,799
negative about AI.

477
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,960
These fellowships were funded by future

478
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:45,120
of life institute

479
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,360
which is a doomer group that thinks that

480
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:52,720
AI is going to become sensient and

481
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:55,120
replace humans and they were funded by

482
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,640
a donation by Vitalic Buterine from

483
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,240
Ethereum. It's an interesting story

484
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,520
actually. He donated his dog coins to

485
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,200
future of life. They ended up being

486
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,880
worth $600 million.

487
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,320
>> Dogecoins.

488
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,120
>> Doge. And then you remember how there

489
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,600
was like those other dog coins.

490
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,000
>> She Oh, he had a collection of dog

491
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,039
coins. Got it.

492
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,720
>> He had a collection of dog coins.

493
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,280
Apparently people like air dropped them

494
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,600
to him as like a promotional thing.

495
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,960
>> Got it.

496
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,799
>> I don't think he wanted them. So he's

497
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,400
like, "How do I get rid of them?" So he

498
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,400
donates them to Future of Life and they

499
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,799
end up being worth $600 million. So by

500
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,799
this

501
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,360
>> Oh my god. almost like this accident.

502
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,600
This Doomer think tank ends up with a

503
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,039
$600 million war chest and they've been

504
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,880
funding these journalism fellowships.

505
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,600
They've been funding grants for

506
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,080
academics to study AI. Obviously, that's

507
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,480
going to end up being very negative. And

508
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,080
they are funding a lot of these nimi

509
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,080
organizations that are opposing data

510
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,840
centers because their goal is just to

511
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,320
get it to stop. That's their goal. They

512
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,160
just want the development to stop. And

513
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,919
you can't, I don't think, underestimate

514
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,559
how much of an impact this has had on

515
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,320
the public discourse. But if you look at

516
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,480
their actual claims, like for example,

517
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,039
the water use claims, it's a total hoax.

518
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,280
I mean, these AI data do not use a lot

519
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,240
of

520
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,480
>> Yeah, that was one of the things I

521
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,000
wanted to get into because yeah,

522
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,880
compared to a golf course, they're not

523
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,200
using that much or or walnuts and, you

524
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,760
know, almonds in central California. So,

525
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,520
I think it is worth maybe just

526
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,120
>> throwing a lot of spaghetti at the wall.

527
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,799
Look, you have to remember who was who

528
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,039
was Ida Tarbel because it's quite

529
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,360
interesting in the context of this. Ida

530
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,520
Tarbell was this American writer again

531
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,280
in the Gilded Age. She was part of the

532
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,320
Muckwreckers which was a group of

533
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,240
journalists that were doing

534
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:38,080
investigative research around the abuses

535
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,840
of the industrial revolution, labor

536
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,240
abuses and the like. And she took on

537
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,400
sandal. Exactly. If you look at that

538
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,760
example, I'm sure that the people in

539
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,840
this current generation who have a

540
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,640
Tarbell fellowship, what they're living

541
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:54,160
out is this desire to tell a story about

542
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,679
exploitation and wrong and misdoing. The

543
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,919
problem is that these things don't

544
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,960
factually hold together, but

545
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,440
unfortunately it adds to the perception

546
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,200
problem that we have and that has been

547
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,720
growing. As Sax said, like so many of

548
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,960
these things have been debunked, but

549
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,039
it's playing whack-a-ole, Jason, because

550
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,200
they'll throw the water thing out. It'll

551
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,679
get debunked next week. We'll probably

552
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,400
something about liquid cooling and all

553
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,080
the PAS and forever chemicals. We'll

554
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,600
have to debunk that. Then we'll go to

555
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,799
like air cooling and how that's a

556
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,960
problem. Then we'll go to something

557
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,440
else. Eventually, it'll be the upper

558
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,000
land grouse, but they're not going to

559
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,720
stop.

560
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,080
>> Sax, how do you do you have a plan to

561
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,840
reframe this to the American public?

562
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,080
You're explaining how these bad things

563
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,120
are happening and all the evil forces at

564
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,360
work behind the scenes.

565
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,880
>> Well, look, it's not evil forces, but I

566
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,039
don't think people understand the extent

567
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,080
to which the discourse has been impacted

568
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,159
by a few anti- AI tech billionaire.

569
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,799
>> I brought it up every week and on your

570
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,000
text.

571
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,679
>> I brought it up. Hold on. I brought it

572
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,360
up on this show and I tweeted about it

573
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,520
way back in November. Yeah.

574
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,679
>> And I linked to a writer named Nerret

575
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,320
Weisslat who has analyzed this whole

576
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,000
doomer industrial complex and she has

577
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,000
shown that there are hundreds of these

578
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,720
front organizations and they're all

579
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,559
really just funded by a few big tech

580
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,039
billionaires. It's Dustin Moskovitz, Yan

581
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,120
Talin and Vitalic Buterine. Well, when I

582
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,880
first described this, people thought

583
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,400
that this sounds kind of crazy like a

584
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,480
conspiracy theory. And then sure enough,

585
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,799
Semaphore comes out with the article

586
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,640
explaining that all these journalism

587
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,840
jobs are being funded by future of life,

588
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,000
which was the big donation by Vitalic

589
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,400
Buterine. So my point is just you can't

590
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,159
underestimate the extent to which a few

591
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,480
billionaires who've donated over a

592
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,080
billion dollars to this cause have

593
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,039
distorted the public debate. And you

594
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,120
really see this actually in the relative

595
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,679
popularity of AI in the United States

596
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,520
versus China. So there's recently a poll

597
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,039
on they call it AI optimism where they

598
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,240
ask people do you believe that the

599
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,159
benefits of AI will outweigh the harms.

600
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,559
83% of people in China believe the

601
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:58,240
benefits will outweigh the harms or AI

602
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:00,880
optimistic. In the US it's only 39%.

603
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,000
>> So again the discourse has really been

604
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,679
affected by a few of these

605
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,400
>> institutions. Let's say let's say that's

606
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,799
all true.

607
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,960
>> Yeah. My question to you is, what's your

608
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,799
plan to turn this around and explain to

609
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,960
the American people why they should be

610
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,080
optimistic about this? What's your plan,

611
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,280
David?

612
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,280
>> Well, look, I mean, you're right that we

613
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,799
have to flip the narrative around. And I

614
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,320
I do think that the tech companies have

615
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,520
done a really bad job explaining the

616
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,880
benefits. We talked about this with

617
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,039
Tucker. I think he brought up some

618
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,280
really good points. And you're right,

619
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,120
like the the AI companies lean way too

620
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,440
much into the whole job loss narrative

621
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,039
as as a way to explain their value prop.

622
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,799
And I think it's just either what Jamath

623
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,120
has said, which is this is about their

624
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,039
next fundraising round, or it's a form

625
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,760
of laziness because it's easier to

626
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,679
describe job loss or job replacement

627
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,600
than it is productivity, right? Like

628
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,000
multiffactor productivity is a difficult

629
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,760
concept to explain. So I do think that

630
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,080
they've played into this narrative. But

631
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,240
I think that what we have to do here is

632
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,880
just debunk these narratives. Again, no

633
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,360
evidence of job loss yet. No evidence of

634
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,360
the the water problems. I think the

635
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,520
electricity issues with data centers are

636
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,880
addressable. You have to let the AI

637
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,960
companies build their own power. They

638
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,080
don't have to connect to the grid. In

639
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,159
fact, that's what President Trump has

640
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,520
called for for the last 6 months is to

641
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,200
let the AI companies build their own

642
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,960
power so they're not drawing on the

643
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,559
grid. So, that problem is easily

644
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,400
addressed as well. Talking about the

645
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,240
affordability problem, but you're right,

646
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,080
we have to get the message out how this

647
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,760
technology will benefit Americans. And

648
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,840
the bottom line is, look, I've always

649
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,760
said I'm a technorealist, not a techno

650
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,840
accelerationist. Because at the end of

651
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,120
the day we don't have a choice. I mean

652
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,640
yeah China is gonna develop the

653
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,960
technology if we don't.

654
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
>> Okay.

655
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,559
>> So we don't really have a choice.

656
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,480
>> I you know as I said last week I think

657
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,520
the three most pressing issues chimat

658
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,520
education housing and healthcare. And

659
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,000
our industry is in a unique position to

660
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,799
use AI to impact all three of those. So

661
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,799
why don't we as an industry collectively

662
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,480
explain all the great things going on

663
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,600
there. I gave a shout out to Daniel,

664
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,520
Prenovo, Pernovo rather, all these great

665
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,960
companies analyzing our blood. There's

666
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,640
so much going on in healthcare that

667
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,240
could massively lower the cost, make

668
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,919
people's lives better.

669
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,919
>> Obviously, in construction, you could

670
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,919
have incredible advances, and certainly

671
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,520
in education, but we haven't explained

672
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,880
those three things. What's your point?

673
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,760
Is there anything you can think of to

674
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,360
add to that list?

675
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,840
>> We have to understand the president and

676
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,200
Sachs, they're responsible for

677
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:24,080
shephering the GDP of America. And as

678
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,960
Sax said, half of American GDP over the

679
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,960
next few years is forecasted to come

680
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,039
from all of the capital that goes in to

681
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,640
build out our capabilities in AI. We

682
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,559
need this to happen. There's the

683
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,679
existential reason why, but there's also

684
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:40,960
a basic economic reason why. So Jason,

685
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,600
the social license comes when off to the

686
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,600
side, the private companies

687
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,400
start to take this perception problem

688
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,080
more seriously. So to your point, are

689
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,559
there things that they can do around

690
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,480
housing? Yes. And again, not to frontr

691
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,919
run, they're actively working on

692
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,760
something that I think could be

693
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,840
transformational separately. Could they

694
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,520
do something on healthcare? TBD, but we

695
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,240
should look at it. Can you do something

696
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,360
in education? TBD, but we should look at

697
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,799
it. But the point is, if you can have

698
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,880
the same companies that are on the

699
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,120
forward foot building this revolution

700
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,840
for us, recognize that we need to bring

701
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,400
some more folks along take some of their

702
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,480
balance sheet capital and invest it to

703
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,039
create this social license to operate.

704
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,840
We will flip this perception on its

705
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,440
head.

706
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,799
>> Yeah, I think it's well said. And you

707
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,240
know, there was a really interesting I

708
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,559
don't you guys must remember this. The

709
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,120
AT&T commercials, you will. Do you

710
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,480
remember those

711
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,640
>> by the way? Sorry, that's another great

712
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,480
example, Jason. AT&T at the turn of the

713
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,080
century. What did they do? They took

714
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,559
their capital and they created Bell

715
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,039
Labs. What did Bell Labs do? Bell Labs

716
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,960
drove all of modern information theory.

717
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,279
It was the precursor to the internet.

718
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,320
They did so much fundamental research. I

719
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,159
want to be clear. I don't think that

720
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,360
this is a five alarm fire. This is very

721
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:56,159
fixible right now. And the litmus test

722
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,840
quite honestly is in 3, four, five, six

723
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,240
months. Jason, when you see the trickle

724
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,559
of progress if we can get organized,

725
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,240
does your perception change and does the

726
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,640
language that you use and the tone that

727
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,960
you've used over these last 6 months has

728
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,480
me?

729
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,640
>> No, no, no. I'm actually thinking that

730
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,240
you've actually been quite a good early

731
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,159
warning system

732
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,440
>> for what a certain percentage of

733
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,279
Americans think. And so,

734
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,440
>> yes, I predicted it perfectly. Yes.

735
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,200
>> It's been extremely useful. But now we

736
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,159
got to act on it and you have to change

737
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,919
your mind.

738
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,640
>> Oh, no. No. My my mind has been very

739
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,240
crystal clear. I won't let you

740
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,760
you know, tell what I'm saying is my

741
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,080
opinion has been job displacements

742
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,520
coming.

743
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,440
>> Jason, let me be clear. We have to earn

744
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,200
you changing your mind publicly on this

745
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,080
show. If we do that, we're back in a

746
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,919
good place.

747
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,840
>> Uh, yeah. No, I think that you're saying

748
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,000
that in a very condescending way. I have

749
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,799
brought up I have brought up Okay.

750
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,760
Unintentionally.

751
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,360
>> Here, let me let me try to say again.

752
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,880
Sorry. Let me try this again. We have

753
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,679
>> You're saying it as if I'm misguided.

754
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,200
>> No, no, no. You have a perception

755
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,400
>> which is what do you think my perception

756
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,960
is? that on the balance it's a coin flip

757
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,840
about whether AI is going to be

758
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,840
>> all good for all people or very good for

759
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,840
a small subset of people. That's what I

760
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,440
would roughly say that's I would say

761
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,600
that's accurate job.

762
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,240
So let me finish. So if we can execute

763
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,000
this plan again, meaning marry all the

764
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,919
stuff we're doing on the forward foot

765
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,679
within in investing

766
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,159
>> with some of the stuff that we also need

767
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,159
to do to bring a broader swath of the

768
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,279
American population along.

769
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,520
>> Yeah.

770
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,039
>> You will have a different perception if

771
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,520
we are successful. And what I'm saying

772
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,360
is you've had this one perception and

773
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,559
our goal would be to shift you and

774
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,600
people like you.

775
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,880
>> Okay. I I I take it I think it's

776
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,679
completely fair. Yeah. I have been

777
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,799
trying to bring up that as an industry,

778
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,880
we have not recognized people's valid

779
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,400
concerns about job displacement. That's

780
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,760
all I've brought up on this program. I'm

781
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,840
not saying I think it's going to be

782
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,799
cataclysmic or we can't handle it. But I

783
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,720
think if we constantly talk about, hey,

784
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,760
winning the AI race in China, that's

785
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,559
abstract for people. And if we deny the

786
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,120
fact that robo taxis and human robotics

787
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,840
are coming and intelligent people like

788
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Elon or other leaders are saying, "Yeah,

789
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,399
we're we're planning on replacing those

790
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,960
jobs. We're doing a terrible job

791
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,480
communicating this." And I do think part

792
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,399
of this is communication and part of it

793
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,919
is, "Hey, these are valid concerns." So

794
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,039
I think great resolution. Yeah, sure.

795
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,039
I'll be the litmus.

796
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,399
>> Do you guys know what um the Mottton

797
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,679
Bailey fallacy is?

798
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,640
>> No, explain it to the audience. I mean,

799
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,159
I think I've heard of it, but

800
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,799
>> the M and Bailey Castle is an early

801
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:29,440
medieval fortification where there's

802
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,919
like a very protected area, the keep or

803
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,559
the M. And then the Bailey is kind of

804
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,880
this looser area that's harder to

805
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,600
defend. Right. So, what happens is if

806
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,559
they need to retreat, they'll go into

807
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,640
the M. Okay.

808
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,880
>> Yeah. Lord of the Rings. Right. Right.

809
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,880
So, this has become known as a debating

810
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:52,000
trick or fallacy where people will make

811
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,440
a really outrageous claim, which is

812
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,080
they'll they'll basically run to the

813
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,720
Bailey and then when you prove that it's

814
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,120
false, they'll run back into the M and

815
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,200
say something very unobjectionable. So,

816
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,880
in the context of like the AI job loss

817
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,520
fallacy,

818
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,279
the Bailey is people will say this is

819
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,960
causing massive job loss, massive

820
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,200
disruption. It's already here. you can

821
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,039
see it and then when I point out well

822
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,799
actually if you look at the Yale Budget

823
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,360
Lab study or you look now at the

824
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,039
Vanguard study there is no job loss then

825
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,320
they'll retreat into the M and they'll

826
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,799
say no no no I'm talking about what's

827
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,080
going to happen in the future which is a

828
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:29,120
position that's fundamentally

829
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,279
irrefutable and then when I point that

830
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,799
out well wait you just totally change

831
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,080
what you're saying you're like no no no

832
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,000
I was only talking about the future and

833
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,960
then as soon as we sort of seem to have

834
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,640
agreement

835
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,000
>> then the people in the M will race out

836
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,840
to the Bailey and basically saying well

837
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,760
look at happening with Uber drivers or

838
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,520
what have you. So there is this Mott and

839
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,360
Bailey thing happening all the time on

840
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,760
this job loss question

841
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,919
>> and I just want people to be straight

842
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,520
about or honest about it which is look

843
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,840
if your claim is that this will cause

844
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,320
job loss in the future. It's true. I

845
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,080
can't refute that because none of us can

846
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,919
prove what's going to happen in the

847
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,559
future. But be honest about what's

848
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:07,440
happening today. And in the first three

849
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,880
years after the launch of AI chatbots,

850
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,799
there's been no discernable disruption

851
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,960
to the labor market and the early

852
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,960
studies and data are showing

853
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,039
>> wage increases and actually job

854
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,200
increases and there's definitely job

855
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,320
increases in blue collars because of the

856
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,360
construction boom.

857
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,880
>> This has been our first debate club

858
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,720
corner. Every week we're going to teach

859
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,120
you how to debate better here. No, it's

860
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,799
you know and I I appreciate that and I

861
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,200
have really tried to say here like I'm

862
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,960
not a doomerist at all. you know the

863
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,279
statistics I look at you know I talk to

864
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,520
Dar I have actually sincerely that's why

865
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,240
I don't use I use displacement you know

866
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:45,919
I really use refined language I do I do

867
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:48,559
and when I talked to DA he told me in

868
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:51,440
areas where robo taxis like Whimo are

869
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,360
occurring what they did specifically to

870
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,240
deal with this issue was they stopped

871
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:59,279
trying to hire drivers in cal in Los

872
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,520
Angeles and in San Francisco because

873
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,200
there are so many whimos they don't want

874
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,039
them to have a had experience. So, you

875
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,799
know, you

876
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,080
wherever in the castle we're talking

877
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:12,159
about this, I I I don't have a a horse

878
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,960
in this race. I'm not part of this habal

879
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:17,760
of, you know, Dustin Mosvitz's people. I

880
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,840
just know from talking to Uber and Whimo

881
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,039
and these other companies and, you know,

882
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,720
other companies that are building

883
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,080
software where they're trying to

884
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,000
eliminate jobs. And so, I'm just

885
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,600
bringing that up as a a really

886
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,520
interesting example. Uber and Whimo,

887
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,640
Elon with Tesla, they are actually

888
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,080
making plans right now to deal with this

889
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,440
displacement of drivers and they're

890
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,880
coming up with new products and services

891
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,960
for those drivers. So, one of the things

892
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,399
they're doing is data labeling at Uber.

893
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,519
They they bought a data labeling company

894
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,640
and they're taking the drivers and

895
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,080
saying, "Hey, you want to do some data

896
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,480
labeling over here?" And actually

897
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,000
creating AI jobs for them. So, this is,

898
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,120
you know, uh something that the whole

899
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,559
industry is working on.

900
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,039
>> Look, there's going to be a spectrum,

901
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,720
right? Some jobs are going to change,

902
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,480
some jobs will be eliminated. The

903
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,320
question is with respect to job

904
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,720
eliminations, will that be more than

905
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,159
offset by the net new job creations? If

906
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,399
you're looking at things like Uber

907
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,919
drivers and we go to full self-driving,

908
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,399
then obviously there's going to be some

909
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,679
category of job loss there. So, I'm not

910
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,919
claiming that there's not going to be

911
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,480
any elimination of certain types of

912
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,919
jobs, but I believe that on the whole,

913
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,080
what we're seeing is that when you

914
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,840
improve the productivity of workers,

915
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,320
their wages go up and there's more

916
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,960
demand for their labor, not less. That's

917
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,320
what the data is showing so far and I

918
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,600
just don't think you get that from the

919
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,039
media right now because they are

920
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,120
promoting this dumer narrative and a lot

921
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,919
of that is astroturfed by these

922
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,519
enormously deeped organizations that

923
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,399
have been funded by a few effective

924
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,640
altruists. All right, topic number two.

925
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:46,159
Economic numbers are out. It's a mixed

926
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:48,720
bag. Unemployment rate is up and

927
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,880
government payrolls are down. Inflation

928
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,799
somewhere in between. Let's get into the

929
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,720
numbers here. Fun with numbers.

930
00:32:52,799 --> 00:33:00,720
unemployment rate rose to 4.6% from 4.4%

931
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,600
in September and 4% in January of 2025

932
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,720
when President Trump took over. US

933
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,600
economy added 64,000 jobs in new jobs in

934
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:13,279
November. October saw about 104,000 job

935
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,720
losses, but 162,000 of those job losses

936
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,039
came from the federal government. You

937
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,760
remember the Doge buybacks, friend of

938
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,360
the pod Elon Musk was involved in. Uh

939
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,960
those all took effect at the end of

940
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,799
September. So, there was a little bit of

941
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,799
a balloon payment that occurred. An

942
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,559
analyst from Moody's says, quote, "It's

943
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,159
a frozen job market. There's not much

944
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,080
hiring. There's not much firing

945
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,519
happened." That tracks with what I'm

946
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,840
seeing on the ground. Meanwhile,

947
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,679
inflation came in better than expected

948
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:43,120
at 2.7%, beating the 3.1%

949
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:47,039
expectation, but still far away from the

950
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:51,039
2% target for the Fed. Trump gave an

951
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:54,159
18minute very loud emphatic address to

952
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:57,039
the nation last night and it was not

953
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,039
that we're invading Venezuela. It was uh

954
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,640
mostly him talking about his

955
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,240
accomplishments

956
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:07,279
in terms of uh prices and affordability

957
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,599
and uh a little bit of admonishing

958
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,599
Biden. Here's a 20 second clip. The last

959
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,359
administration and their allies in

960
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,000
Congress looted our treasury for

961
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:18,159
trillions of dollars, driving up prices

962
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,200
and everything at levels never seen

963
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:24,879
before. I am bringing those high prices

964
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:27,839
down and bringing them down very fast.

965
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,200
>> Sax, your thoughts on the economic data.

966
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,399
>> Well, you're you're painting it as

967
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,919
you're painting the economic data as

968
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,599
mixed. I don't know how you have a

969
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,679
economic report that's better than what

970
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,159
we just had today. So, first of all, we

971
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,879
saw that CPI came in at 2.7% like you

972
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,560
said, but the expectations were 3.1%.

973
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,879
That's why the market is rallying today

974
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,720
in a big way. Core inflation is down to

975
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,200
2.6%.

976
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,800
These are significant beats. And this

977
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:55,119
puts core CPI inflation in the US at its

978
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,520
lowest level since March of 2021. So,

979
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,119
since the whole CO thing. And if you

980
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,680
listen to Kevin Hasset, he said that

981
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,480
over the past 3 months, core inflation's

982
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,480
been running at 1.6%. So the trend line

983
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,560
is going down even further. So it looks

984
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,720
to me like inflation's rolling over and

985
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,320
that's just about a solved problem which

986
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,520
is really good news for what it implies

987
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,680
for interest rates because it implies

988
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,200
that interest rates are coming down and

989
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,599
that's going to bring down things like

990
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,359
mortgage costs and the costs of

991
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,640
financing a car payment and things like

992
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:26,640
that. Now you talk about unemployment. I

993
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:30,720
think the unemployment news is very very

994
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:33,599
good. So if you look at the data from

995
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,400
September to November, the overall

996
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:39,760
employment is down 41,000. But why was

997
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,440
that? Private employment was up 121,000,

998
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,240
but government employment in the last 2

999
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,839
months has declined by 162,000. So this

1000
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,280
is what the media was focused on is they

1001
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,200
were trying to claim that unemployment

1002
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,680
was up, but actually it's just that the

1003
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,040
government jobs decreased. Why did the

1004
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,640
government jobs decrease? Well, you

1005
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,400
remember that when Doge went in and made

1006
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,720
their cuts at the beginning of the year,

1007
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,119
they offered people a buyout as of

1008
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,520
October 1st. Now, some people took the

1009
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,359
buyout right away, but a lot more waited

1010
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,760
until the last possible day, which was

1011
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:11,119
October 1st. And that's why you saw this

1012
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,280
big spike in October unemployment, but

1013
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,119
those are government jobs that are being

1014
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,839
cut. And moreover, there are people who

1015
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,400
voluntarily wanted to take the buyout

1016
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,839
and they took that deal. So again, I

1017
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,560
think the employment picture is looking

1018
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,040
actually quite good and if you believe

1019
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,960
what we believe, you don't want an

1020
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,200
excessive number of government jobs. And

1021
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,720
President Trump has presided over, I

1022
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,880
think, the first decrease in the federal

1023
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:39,760
workforce in decades. We've seen a 10.7%

1024
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,920
decrease in federal workers in 2025.

1025
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,160
Basically, the number's gone from 2.4

1026
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,480
million to 2.15 million. I know that'll

1027
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,200
make Freeberg very happy. But look, what

1028
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,599
we had during the Biden years is we had

1029
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,839
9% inflation. We had a very weak

1030
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,960
economy. We did have a recession. It was

1031
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:59,119
that two quarter shallow recession. And

1032
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,640
the media even tried to start redefining

1033
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,320
what a recession was to avoid those

1034
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,599
headlines. But what the Biden

1035
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,920
administration did in response to that

1036
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,720
is they went hog wild with government

1037
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:12,320
hiring. And what we're seeing now is

1038
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,520
inflation is now coming back down and

1039
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,200
we're seeing the number of government

1040
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,520
workers come down to a more reasonable

1041
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,920
level and the private economy is making

1042
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:23,119
up for it. We still have a relatively

1043
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,560
historically low unemployment rate. So

1044
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,520
those numbers look good. Then you look

1045
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,920
at the deficit. We've reduced the

1046
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,680
deficit year-over-year by 600 billion.

1047
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,000
That will help bring interest rates

1048
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,000
down. And then on prices, you got the

1049
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,720
lowest gas prices in five years, below

1050
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,599
$3 nationally. And then finally, on

1051
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:45,200
wages, real wages are up by over $1,000

1052
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:47,359
on average. And um it's $1,300 for

1053
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,920
factory workers, $1,800 for construction

1054
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:52,320
workers. And again, that's a big change

1055
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,599
from the buying years where you saw that

1056
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:59,359
in real terms, wages went down by about

1057
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,200
$3,000 on average per worker. So look, I

1058
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,680
mean, it seems to me like we're on the

1059
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,400
cusp of a golden age here. I don't see

1060
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,320
how the numbers could really be better.

1061
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,160
And then on top of it, again, you've got

1062
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,760
this AI tailwind, which I think is a

1063
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,280
huge positive, not a negative, which is

1064
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:18,079
adding roughly 2% GDP growth every year

1065
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,680
because of huge capex investment with so

1066
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,200
far no job loss associated with that. So

1067
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,440
I would just say sit back and enjoy

1068
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,800
this. I think we're headed for a gang

1069
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,280
busters 2026. Rates are coming down.

1070
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,200
Inflation's coming down. And you're also

1071
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,040
getting tax cuts going into effect next

1072
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,599
year because of the big beautiful bill.

1073
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,520
No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no

1074
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,760
tax on social security, plus the

1075
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,680
standard deductions being beefed up. So

1076
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,520
people haven't even felt the benefit of

1077
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,119
those tax cuts. That's coming in in

1078
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,160
April. I don't see how things could be

1079
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,200
much better.

1080
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,040
>> Okay, Freeberg, any thoughts here on the

1081
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,720
data as it's come in? Or Chimath? I'll

1082
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,920
I'll go to either one of you.

1083
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,119
>> Directionally, I think it's really

1084
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,839
positive. You want to see

1085
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,240
private sector jobs growing and the

1086
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,560
shrinkage of government sector jobs has

1087
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,079
profound impacts not just on the budget,

1088
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:13,359
but it starts to create obvious air

1089
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:16,160
pockets where you get a little bit more

1090
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:18,000
rational regulation. You can deregulate

1091
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,920
in the appropriate places. You can shift

1092
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
the burden and the responsibility to

1093
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,359
private industry. So, it's more than

1094
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,960
just what's in the numbers that I think

1095
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,320
is positive. I've told you this story

1096
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,920
before, Jason, to do some of the things

1097
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,400
that I've wanted to do. I'll give you an

1098
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,000
example. When we started a battery

1099
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,720
business 5 years ago, when we filed with

1100
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,320
the DOE, the Department of Energy, these

1101
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,800
are 700page reports. You spend millions

1102
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,079
of dollars and you hire teams of 50 and

1103
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,200
100 people. And what are we trying to

1104
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,720
do? We're trying to build a battery

1105
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,520
business in the United States so that we

1106
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,200
can delever from the Chinese.

1107
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,280
to the extent that we could do that a

1108
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,599
little bit simpler and a little bit

1109
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,079
easier because there's fewer folks and

1110
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,760
so the burden goes to state and local

1111
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,599
regulators which we all already have to

1112
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,960
deal with. These are just generally good

1113
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,280
things for productivity. They're

1114
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,800
generally good things for GDP. It allows

1115
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,320
us to invest more aggressively in the

1116
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,520
things that help America. So it's

1117
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,040
trending in the right direction. By the

1118
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,560
way, Sachs didn't mention this

1119
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,640
explicitly, but I'll say it.

1120
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,040
>> The other thing in 26 is you get a bunch

1121
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,800
of tax cuts that kick in. No tax on

1122
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,800
tips, no tax on overtime. the

1123
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,400
deductibility of the cost of interest

1124
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,640
for

1125
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,160
things like car loans.

1126
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,599
These are big stimulation

1127
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,960
accelerated depreciation. You have big

1128
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,560
stimulative actions for the United

1129
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,040
States economy.

1130
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,520
>> Yeah. I think what you guys are missing

1131
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,160
>> respectfully is that uh

1132
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,160
>> you know uh Trump promised something

1133
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,079
completely different. He said starting

1134
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,920
on day one we will end inflation and

1135
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,760
make America affordable again to bring

1136
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,520
down the prices of all goods. And when

1137
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,240
he was running for election, he promised

1138
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,520
the Americans that he would reduce

1139
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:58,079
prices. Now, what's happened is prices

1140
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,960
have not come down. They've gone up 2.5

1141
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,960
to 3.1%. But what really matters, and I

1142
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,119
think you guys are doing a great job,

1143
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,640
you know, pro- administration, part of

1144
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,160
the administration. What you're missing

1145
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,000
is the American people don't believe

1146
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,200
you. And the American people are

1147
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,359
experiencing something different. And

1148
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,040
when you look at the uh approval rating,

1149
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,280
Trump's approval rating is at its

1150
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,880
historic lows. and specifically on

1151
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,800
inflation. Pull up the silver bullet and

1152
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,560
meta analysis there. This is the

1153
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,319
disconnect and this is why it seemed

1154
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,599
tonedeaf last night when Trump was

1155
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,680
telling everybody it's great and when

1156
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,599
you say it's the golden age, Americans

1157
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,560
aren't experiencing that. That's just

1158
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,720
not what they experience. They are

1159
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,040
experiencing grocery prices that have

1160
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,119
continued to go up and they are

1161
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,280
experiencing unemployment that's gone up

1162
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,040
15%. Whether it's the federal employees,

1163
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,880
whether it's private sector, and you

1164
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,800
debate the numbers, or there's a golden

1165
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,560
age coming because of no tax on tips,

1166
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,560
these are all talking points. What the

1167
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,640
American people remember is the Trump

1168
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,440
administration said prices would go

1169
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,800
down. Prices have gone up. That jobs and

1170
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,079
manufacturing, there'd be all these

1171
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,359
incredible manufacturing things.

1172
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,599
Obviously, that's going to take years.

1173
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:03,839
That has not happened yet. So, I hope

1174
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,680
for the best. I hope inflation goes down

1175
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:07,359
to two. And I hope they turn this

1176
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,880
around. But the American people don't

1177
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,040
believe the Trump administration. And

1178
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,680
it's a big difference between promising

1179
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,599
stuff in 2024 and delivering it. And

1180
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,599
here we are in the first year and the

1181
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,480
delivery that's come in from the Trump

1182
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:23,200
administration on inflation and on the

1183
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,200
economy is not good if you're in the

1184
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,440
bottom half of society that doesn't own

1185
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,040
equities. Period. Full stop.

1186
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,880
>> So, first of all, prices have come down.

1187
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,359
You look at gas prices are the lowest in

1188
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,920
five years. They're below $3 nationally.

1189
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:37,839
Now, I don't know how you want a new

1190
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,760
administration to come in and literally

1191
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,880
affect every single change on day one.

1192
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,160
How do you do that?

1193
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,280
>> Oh, no. That's just what he said.

1194
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,160
>> No. What the president said is they

1195
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,760
would start working on they would start.

1196
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,640
>> I'm not saying it's possible. That's

1197
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,319
what he said.

1198
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,880
>> No, he said he'd start working on it on

1199
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:55,359
day one. And so he did. And look at the

1200
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,920
results. Inflation's now down to 2.7%

1201
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,079
way below expectations. I don't know how

1202
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,319
you want a better report than this.

1203
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:04,000
Unemployment is very low. The only

1204
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:07,359
reason Remember the uh the economic

1205
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,319
target was 3 three and three 3% GDP

1206
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:13,280
growth, 3% deficit to GDP and 3%

1207
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:16,319
inflation. They're below 3% inflation.

1208
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,640
They're above 3% GDP growth and the

1209
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:21,359
deficit to GDP is not where it needs to

1210
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,520
be. So cutting is still ahead. But I

1211
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:26,800
looked at the budgets for 2026 for a

1212
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,640
number of the departments in the cabinet

1213
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,920
over the last couple days and they do

1214
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,960
have big cuts that they're trying to

1215
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,319
implement across the federal government.

1216
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,000
We're going to be interviewing Scott

1217
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:38,720
Bessent tomorrow morning that'll come

1218
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,480
out shortly after this episode airs. But

1219
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,800
this is the catchup conversation with

1220
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,280
Scott on how's the 333 plan going. But

1221
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,560
on two of the three metrics, Jay Cal, it

1222
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,839
does appear like things are good. I'm

1223
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,599
not trying to be a spokesperson for the

1224
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,119
Trump administration, but I'd say if you

1225
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,480
look at this just from the raw economic

1226
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,960
data and the the goals of the

1227
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,680
administration following that, there

1228
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,040
should be a flow through in terms of job

1229
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,720
growth, the flow through in terms of

1230
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,839
affordability, in terms of wage growth,

1231
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,200
all those other sort of economic

1232
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,680
indicators that actually affect people

1233
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,359
on Main Street every day. Uh that's also

1234
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,280
TBD in the narrative is still to be

1235
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,960
written, but those high level economic

1236
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,480
goals are still, you know, are starting

1237
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,160
to kind of fall within the the framework

1238
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,359
of what they set out to do, which is

1239
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,720
generally good, right?

1240
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,800
>> Yeah. I'm just pointing out the

1241
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,240
disconnect again. This is the disconnect

1242
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,920
with the American people. I mean,

1243
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,400
>> no, no, I'm looking at year one.

1244
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,319
>> Just year one. We're here at the end.

1245
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,000
>> Time to implement an agenda.

1246
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,680
>> I totally agree. I'm just telling you

1247
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,599
the American people don't believe the

1248
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,280
Trump administration right now. There's

1249
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,359
more work to do.

1250
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,280
>> That's the data that came out today is

1251
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:39,119
looking awesome. By the way, that

1252
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,680
Vanguard report that I mentioned that

1253
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:46,400
also exposes the AI job loss hoax, it

1254
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,200
also has a new economic assessment for

1255
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,079
next year is projecting 3% growth for

1256
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,240
next year, which I think is

1257
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,880
conservative, and an improved labor

1258
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,359
market outlook for 2026, and it says the

1259
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,640
most robust improvement will come in the

1260
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:03,200
second half of the year. So, Vanguard is

1261
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,480
saying that 2026 is looking very good.

1262
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,400
And by the way, that's when the fight

1263
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,319
for Congress will unfold is next year.

1264
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,560
So, you know, the thing about polls is

1265
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,400
it's obviously just a snapshot in time

1266
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,680
and it doesn't tell you what things are

1267
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,359
going to look like 6 months from now or

1268
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,720
a year from now. I think they're going

1269
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,800
to look very good.

1270
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,400
>> Yeah. I mean, maybe he turns it around.

1271
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,319
>> I think it's already been turned around.

1272
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,520
It just takes time to kick in.

1273
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,960
>> Yeah. I mean, the the public's

1274
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,280
perception it hasn't turned around and

1275
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,760
inflation was supposed to go down and it

1276
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,599
stayed.

1277
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,800
>> It has. No, it stayed at it's still way

1278
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,000
above the 2%

1279
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,720
>> 1.6% for the last three months.

1280
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,359
>> No, it has not. It was just 2.7.

1281
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,960
>> No, that's the problem I think with the

1282
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,640
administration and your part of it. Like

1283
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,400
you guys cherry pick numbers and it's

1284
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,480
not matching the numbers on the field.

1285
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,240
So when you cherryick cherry picking,

1286
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,240
this says CPI report.

1287
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,440
>> The the the number

1288
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:58,160
>> open the cover of the Wall Street

1289
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:59,599
Journal. 2.7 Hold on. 2.7% CPI 2.6% 6%

1290
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,480
core

1291
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,800
>> 1.6% for last 3 months.

1292
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,880
>> Okay.

1293
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,079
>> What is hard to understand about this?

1294
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,760
Obviously, the last three months are

1295
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,000
going to tell you what the trajectory

1296
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,839
is.

1297
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,440
>> Okay. The the fact is

1298
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:16,560
>> you're looking for every excuse you can

1299
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,640
to basically downplay what is

1300
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,880
>> an awesome report and just look at the

1301
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,960
stock market which is ripping today

1302
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,839
because this is way below expectations.

1303
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,720
You're the only one who's not happy

1304
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,880
about this news, Jacob.

1305
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,800
>> No, no. the the country is not happy

1306
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,480
about it. I I'm not I don't have a horse

1307
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,720
in this race. I'm doing fantastic. I own

1308
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,480
equities. I'm doing better than I ever

1309
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,480
have in my life. I'm talking about how

1310
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,839
the bottom half of America perceives it.

1311
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,839
This is the blind spot of the Trump

1312
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,839
administration. You've proved my point

1313
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,400
by not addressing it. Let's go to the

1314
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,240
next subject.

1315
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,640
>> No, I haven't. What? What?

1316
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,880
>> No, I guess the fact that you guys My

1317
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,839
point is the American people

1318
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,599
>> expected that inflation would go down

1319
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:56,079
and prices would go down. Prices have

1320
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,440
continued to go up. Fed has a 2% target.

1321
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,119
It's a little bit unrealistic to say

1322
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,800
that what you want to you want wait you

1323
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,119
want to have you want to have a negative

1324
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,800
inflation rate.

1325
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,800
>> Trump said prices will go down. They

1326
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,920
have not. That's what the American

1327
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:12,240
people feel. Unemployment has gone up.

1328
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,160
They expect it to go down. So the this

1329
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,599
idea that we're in the golden age is not

1330
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,160
tracking with the bottom half of

1331
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,319
Americans. That's just facts, David.

1332
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,760
It's just facts. You have work to do.

1333
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,680
Trump has work to do. You're you're

1334
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,280
saying that anything less than deflation

1335
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,000
anything less than deflation in your

1336
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,599
view is

1337
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,760
>> I did not say that you keep telling I

1338
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,520
keep telling you what I'm reporting in

1339
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,800
terms of facts then you tell me I said

1340
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,480
something different I didn't say that

1341
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,680
the American people are very

1342
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,200
disappointed in the Trump

1343
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,160
administration's first year when it

1344
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,760
comes to inflation and the economy

1345
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,200
>> I don't understand how the numbers could

1346
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,079
be any better we just blew past

1347
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,079
expectations here 2.7%

1348
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,760
>> I don't know whose expectations I don't

1349
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,760
know whose

1350
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,079
>> pulse you think you have the finger of

1351
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,560
but the economists who put together

1352
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:59,599
>> these expectations

1353
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,720
>> were expect

1354
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,119
one more time for me just pull up the

1355
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,920
chart for me uh so I can just explain

1356
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,680
that this isn't bias on my part I'm just

1357
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,839
putting the fact on the field no it is

1358
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,680
not this is

1359
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:14,079
>> these are numbers that you can look at

1360
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,319
and see that Trump's two worst

1361
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,319
categories right now are the economy and

1362
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,640
inflation the American people thought he

1363
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,160
was

1364
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,119
>> these are snapshots in time and they're

1365
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,559
going to

1366
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:26,319
snapshot time from February goes down.

1367
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,920
That's the snapshot time. Every month

1368
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:30,000
you have 12 months there to look at.

1369
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,680
>> Let me explain. I don't know what's so

1370
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,280
hard about this is a really partisan

1371
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,839
point that you're making it. You're

1372
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,319
basically saying

1373
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,559
>> I'm not part economy is like a giant

1374
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,000
super

1375
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,280
>> tanker. I'm not part

1376
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,920
>> Can I finish my point?

1377
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,520
>> Sure you can.

1378
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,040
>> I mean you must know this and I think

1379
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,119
you're pretending not to. The US economy

1380
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,559
is like a giant super tanker. It takes

1381
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,480
time to turn around. It takes time to

1382
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,520
implement your economic agenda. It took

1383
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,280
the president the first six months of

1384
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,880
the administration to implement the big

1385
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,559
beautiful bill which is his economic

1386
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,599
program. But it doesn't even go into

1387
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:59,040
effect until January 1st. So the tax

1388
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,000
cuts have not gone into effect. The

1389
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:04,960
inflation reductions have happened.

1390
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,880
We've gone from 9% under Biden to now

1391
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,240
2.6% core 1.6% the last 3 months. I

1392
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,760
don't know what more you could want.

1393
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,280
Interest rates have come down. They're

1394
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,760
projected to come down even more because

1395
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,119
inflation's coming down. This is again a

1396
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,480
huge ship that's in the process of

1397
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,000
turning around and I predict that by

1398
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,079
next year the numbers are going to be

1399
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,839
even better. Let me remind you of what

1400
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,920
happened in the early 1980s under Ronald

1401
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:28,480
Reagan when Reagan took over. Okay, the

1402
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,319
misery index was at like 20%. Reagan

1403
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,240
implemented his economic agenda, but it

1404
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:35,280
took a couple of years to actually

1405
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:37,680
implement it. By 1983, we actually had a

1406
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,760
very severe recession because Vulkar had

1407
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,520
raised interest rates so much to tame

1408
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,839
inflation. We're lucky we don't have

1409
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,520
that issue today. In any event, it took

1410
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:48,079
like three years for Reagan to implement

1411
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:52,079
his economic agenda and his popularity

1412
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:53,680
was very low by 1983, but by 1984, the

1413
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,280
program had worked and it was morning in

1414
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,920
America again. And he won the biggest

1415
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,000
landslide election, I think, in American

1416
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,800
history. So, you got to give it time for

1417
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,000
the president's agenda to play out and

1418
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:08,480
work. And it certainly looks like after

1419
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,040
10 months that is performing extremely

1420
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,400
well. and we are just beginning to see

1421
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,960
the impact of it.

1422
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,280
>> I think the core issue is Trump

1423
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,440
overpromised and underd delivering year

1424
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,119
one and it's not the golden age for the

1425
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,359
bottom half of Americans and they don't

1426
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:25,280
feel it's the golden age and I think

1427
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,880
just t tackling that head on and saying

1428
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,200
yeah we have more work to do and I

1429
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,880
actually think that's what the address

1430
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,680
last night was about. I suspect

1431
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,200
somebody, maybe Susie or the the chief

1432
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,000
of staff or somebody said, "Hey, we got

1433
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:41,680
to start communicating better about the

1434
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,440
cost of living and our promises during

1435
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,040
the election so that we turn this

1436
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,480
around." That's actually what I think is

1437
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,160
happening. But I I don't have a horse in

1438
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,680
this race. I'm doing fabulous because I

1439
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:53,680
own equities. I'm happy. I'm concerned,

1440
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,040
sure, that the bottom half of society

1441
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,440
needs to do a little bit better. That's

1442
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,880
all. All right. But you, you know,

1443
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,160
listen, I I'm never going to win with

1444
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,359
you, Saxs, because you're the captain of

1445
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,640
the debate club. You will win every

1446
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,079
debate. You're you're incredible.

1447
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,599
>> Well, look, I mean, like the president

1448
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:07,119
the president made the right point last

1449
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,280
night, which is he inherited a giant

1450
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:13,119
mess. Again, under the Biden years, we

1451
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:15,440
had a $3,000 reduction in in real wages

1452
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:17,760
by American workers. That's already gone

1453
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,599
up by $1,000 under President Trump in

1454
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,359
the first year. But yeah, if you're a

1455
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,440
worker and you're just looking at your

1456
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:25,200
situation, you're underwater 2,000

1457
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,640
relative to where you were 5 years ago.

1458
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,800
So obviously you're going to be salty

1459
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,040
about that, but that's the situation

1460
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,240
that that President Trump inherited. I

1461
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,920
don't know how much more progress you

1462
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,000
could make in 10 months, but give it

1463
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,559
another year and then we'll really see.

1464
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,640
>> All right, I am rooting for you guys. I

1465
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:43,040
hope you turn it around in year two.

1466
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,400
Okay, Freeberg, we got an important

1467
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,839
story here we have to get to.

1468
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,359
>> Do you guys want to hear a crazy

1469
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,559
personal story for 2 minutes as a

1470
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,359
palette cleanser?

1471
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:50,559
>> Oh, 32.

1472
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,920
>> Oh, yes. As a palette cleanser,

1473
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,319
>> this is an amuse bougge.

1474
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,240
>> Okay, this is an amuse. A little a

1475
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:58,079
little pomplamoose sorbet.

1476
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,599
>> This is the craziest story

1477
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,040
>> in my life right now.

1478
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,000
>> Pull up the photo, Nick. The first

1479
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,480
photo.

1480
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,720
>> You guys remember my dog, Monty?

1481
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,359
>> Yeah. This is the virtue signal dog.

1482
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,240
>> Not the virtue signal.

1483
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:12,480
>> Oh, this is the best dog. This is Monty.

1484
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:15,680
>> This is Monty. Monty. Monty was my dog

1485
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:19,200
for 10 years. I got him 10 years ago in

1486
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,640
January and he died suddenly in May. He

1487
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,079
turns out he had a tumor on his heart

1488
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,920
and his heart burst open in front of me

1489
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:26,160
and he died. It was the worst thing. He

1490
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,079
was with me every second of every day

1491
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,760
>> that I wasn't at work. He slept on my

1492
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,280
bed. He was in my office all day. You

1493
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,440
guys have seen him a million times in

1494
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,319
the background during the all-in pod. My

1495
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:39,040
best friend in the world. The greatest

1496
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:40,640
thing I've ever come across in my life.

1497
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:43,920
>> So, he died suddenly. It was very

1498
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:46,240
brutal, very hard. So, I'm at my house

1499
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,640
the other day. My next door neighbor

1500
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:51,839
walks in and he's got this dog on his

1501
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:54,480
leash. Pull up this photo. This is this

1502
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:57,119
dog. So, my next door neighbor finds

1503
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,359
this dog at Rocket Dog Rescue. It was

1504
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:02,079
pulled out of a kill shelter. The vet

1505
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:04,480
estimates this dog is like a decade old.

1506
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,000
Today, I live probably 40 miles away

1507
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,280
from where we got Monty. He was found

1508
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,119
wandering the streets of the Mission

1509
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,359
District in San Francisco. This random

1510
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,599
dog here was found at some random kill

1511
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:15,200
shelter somewhere in California, pulled

1512
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,520
out of the kill shelter a few days ago,

1513
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,359
put into Rocket Dog, and rescued by my

1514
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,480
next door neighbor. Brings him over.

1515
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,920
He's walking him in the street. And I'm

1516
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,319
like, "Oh my god, that dog looks just

1517
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:28,160
like my old dog, Monty." We ran a DNA

1518
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:29,680
test. This dog is Monty's brother.

1519
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,480
>> What?

1520
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:34,720
>> This dog is Monty's brother. It is the

1521
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,480
craziest. There's like a billion dogs on

1522
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,400
planet Earth. And of the billion dogs,

1523
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,000
some random dog from some random litter

1524
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,079
from some street pup in the Mission

1525
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,760
District from a decade ago found its way

1526
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,680
into a shelter, into another rescue

1527
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,280
center, into my next door neighbor's

1528
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,359
arms, and brought back to my house

1529
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,240
months after Monty died. How crazy is

1530
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,319
that?

1531
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,440
What is his personality like?

1532
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,520
>> I'm going to hang out with him this

1533
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,920
afternoon. I got to go see.

1534
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,680
>> But how crazy is this? Just It's Monty's

1535
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,960
actual brother from the same

1536
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,440
>> Monty in fairness.

1537
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,640
>> Monty.

1538
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,359
>> Well, the angles are off.

1539
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,800
>> Step brother.

1540
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:06,720
>> Monty's more robust.

1541
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,240
>> Yeah. Well, Monty was wellfed. This dog

1542
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,880
lived in a freaking kill shelter. So,

1543
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,920
>> Monty was a heck of a dog. Take take 12

1544
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,520
pounds off Monty. But

1545
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,240
>> wait, where's the other tests?

1546
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,760
>> Don't lie.

1547
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,920
>> Where's the uh dog that was being

1548
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,240
tortured by Revlon?

1549
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,880
>> That dog. The dogs have gotten robust,

1550
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,119
too.

1551
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,280
>> Yeah.

1552
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:26,319
>> Was it Rabon who was torturing your

1553
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,760
>> She she Daisy has a thousand siblings,

1554
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:30,880
not just one.

1555
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,559
>> And uh Daisy Daisy I'm fine with. It's

1556
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,760
Mitchell. It's Mitchell Freeberg. I hate

1557
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,200
>> Marshall. Marshall.

1558
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,079
>> Marshall Freeber. I hate Marshall

1559
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,720
Freeberg.

1560
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,319
>> I got to hang out.

1561
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,160
>> He ate the pistachios last Christmas.

1562
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:42,000
Marshall's like a little

1563
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,559
>> Monty's father must have really gotten

1564
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
around San Francisco.

1565
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:47,119
>> He had a great run on

1566
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,640
>> What are the odds of this?

1567
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:50,960
>> Same mother, same father. It's not a

1568
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,680
half brother. This is the same Monty's

1569
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,480
dad was a

1570
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,640
>> same same litter, same dog, same same

1571
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,319
mother, same father, same litter on the

1572
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,920
streets of San Francisco a decade ago.

1573
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:02,079
And they all find their way in different

1574
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,319
parts of California and come to Andy's

1575
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:06,240
buried in my backyard. And this dog

1576
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:08,720
>> samples

1577
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:11,040
love. Was it the summer of the same?

1578
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,240
>> You would say no way, but you got to see

1579
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,760
better shots of it. I'll put more

1580
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,160
>> photo side by side.

1581
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,680
>> Yeah,

1582
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,920
>> this doesn't make sense.

1583
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,880
>> I know. It's the craziest ever. And by

1584
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,160
the way, like

1585
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,839
>> yeah, it doesn't look like they're

1586
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,599
related. I'll be honest with you.

1587
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:25,119
>> Gotta find you a proper photo of

1588
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:27,200
>> What's going on? Chop up with Oki and

1589
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,800
Joker. How old are these dogs now?

1590
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,680
>> Oh my god. From your lips, the God's

1591
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:33,119
yours, bro. Aie is 14 and a half. She

1592
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,000
turns 15 in July.

1593
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,520
>> She's so precious.

1594
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,160
>> And Joker's eight or nine. So Touchwood,

1595
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,800
they're uh

1596
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,800
>> Yeah,

1597
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,240
>> Golden Retrievers don't really live to

1598
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,680
15, but my god, she's been

1599
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,839
>> You got a lot of good years. I was just

1600
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,359
on the I was on the floor last Thursday

1601
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,760
snuggling with her and it was so

1602
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,599
precious.

1603
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,160
>> Well, you know what we did the I think

1604
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:55,440
the best thing that we did was we got

1605
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:58,880
much more disciplined about diet for AI

1606
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,880
when she turned about 13.

1607
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,119
Little bit calorie restricted. It's not

1608
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,440
nearly as much. She lost a few kilos. It

1609
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,040
helped her a lot walking and

1610
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,160
>> she's a little deaf unfortunately, but

1611
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,440
she can see.

1612
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,040
>> Dogs are the best. My god,

1613
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,200
>> dogs are the best. Here's my Here's

1614
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,960
here's my other photo of the dog that

1615
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,520
Chamoth hates. Pull it up just so you

1616
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,160
can see.

1617
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,640
>> Marshall, listen. Last last Christmas at

1618
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,720
Nat's birthday dinner on the 26th, which

1619
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,640
is her birthday, Marshall Freeberg

1620
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,240
jumped on the table, started eating all

1621
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,040
of the pistachios and the nuts,

1622
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,720
>> ruined them,

1623
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,680
>> ruined all of them, slobbered

1624
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,240
everywhere.

1625
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,079
>> All David Freeberg was like, "Oh, look

1626
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,640
at that." Allison Freeberg was like,

1627
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,400
"Marshall Freeberg, they they have no

1628
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,000
control over what's going on."

1629
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,920
>> Here, pull this photo up, Nick. This is

1630
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,280
a a medical issue Marshall Friedberg's

1631
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,520
been dealing with. He wakes up with

1632
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,119
irreoverable erections, so he can't

1633
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,760
walk.

1634
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:48,960
>> What?

1635
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,440
>> Pull this up.

1636
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,119
>> Irreoverable.

1637
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,240
>> So, Nick, you got to blur this out. When

1638
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:57,440
you

1639
00:56:54,240 --> 00:57:00,400
>> Oh, dude's packing.

1640
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:02,079
>> So, this little guy, he wait erection.

1641
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,680
>> He has these erections and well, the

1642
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:05,520
doctors say like, "You just got to wait

1643
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:07,119
and if it ends up staying for too long,

1644
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,960
there's going to be a surgery." But like

1645
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,559
right now, he's okay. But he can't move

1646
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,319
when he gets them and he's stuck and

1647
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,920
he'll just stand there unable to move

1648
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:16,000
for like 20 minutes like with his little

1649
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,240
>> thing happened. I gave Chimat some of my

1650
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,920
roast sparks and he had a similar thing

1651
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,599
happened. He was frozen.

1652
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,160
>> There's there's a Brian Johnson joke in

1653
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:23,280
here. But

1654
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,760
>> that is a problem.

1655
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,880
>> Yeah.

1656
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,440
>> How's Moose doing? Jake's my special

1657
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,280
guy.

1658
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,160
>> Here he is. Special.

1659
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,760
>> Oh,

1660
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,319
>> is that your dog?

1661
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:37,599
>> This is the moose. The moose is trying

1662
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:40,000
to keep Oh, buddy. Oh, buddy. Fish is my

1663
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:41,119
buddy. Oh, good. What are you doing?

1664
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,400
What are you chewing on?

1665
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,000
>> What's he doing?

1666
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,200
>> I think you got a pop. Get that out of

1667
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,839
your mouth. Come on. Get that out of

1668
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:52,200
your mouth. He is such a little love

1669
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:52,200
buddy. Sh love.

1670
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,359
>> It's like a gremlin.

1671
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,200
>> He loves it.

1672
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:00,319
>> It's great. It's great to see you so in

1673
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,559
control.

1674
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:05,119
>> Jason, you're such a natural dog guy,

1675
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,319
Jason.

1676
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:09,280
That's buddy.

1677
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:11,440
>> A disciplinarian. This dog loves food.

1678
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,160
>> You're really and he loves to wrestle.

1679
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,720
>> You're like a modern believable

1680
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,720
at the ranch.

1681
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:19,119
>> Does he headbutt you?

1682
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:21,760
>> The dog whisper

1683
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:23,200
>> Moose. Take it easy, buddy. I know. He

1684
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,880
loves to wrestle this dog.

1685
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,319
>> He's heavy, right? He's

1686
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,839
>> Well, we he added about four or five

1687
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:30,000
pounds cuz he wasn't eating all that

1688
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:31,680
much when we got him. And then we

1689
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,599
realized he needs a little bit of extra

1690
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:36,319
food. We gave him a little more food and

1691
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,680
he became a little less um grumpy

1692
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:40,400
>> and then he just

1693
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:42,319
>> we take him for like maybe three one

1694
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,960
mile walks a day on the ranch.

1695
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:46,559
>> Totally fine. If he misses a walk,

1696
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,480
doggy's got way too much energy. So,

1697
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:49,200
he's not he's a ranch dog, not a city

1698
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,559
dog. This dog

1699
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,240
>> I know. I know. I told you.

1700
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:54,160
>> Yeah, he needs to run. When he doesn't

1701
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:56,400
run, you got a problem. All right, let's

1702
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:58,720
keep going through the docket here. Uh

1703
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,839
that's dog corner. That's K9 corner.

1704
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,680
What do you guys think? That's a good

1705
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:02,240
corner. It's a good cat corner. It's the

1706
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,839
best corner.

1707
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,200
>> But how crazy is that? One like one in a

1708
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:06,559
billion's got to be that this dog lands

1709
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,280
up next to me. It's just the craziest

1710
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,359
thing. Anyway,

1711
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,880
>> yeah. And uh yeah, there's no cat corner

1712
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,559
here. Cats are horrible.

1713
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,079
>> Shout out to our friends at Whimo for

1714
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:16,160
eliminating the cat problem in San

1715
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:18,000
Francisco.

1716
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,920
>> I mean, that's just that was the

1717
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,400
greatest update to their software ever.

1718
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:25,040
If they can eliminate more cats,

1719
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,359
>> what's that paradox that the AI has

1720
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:29,040
where it's like, do I hit the trolley?

1721
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,319
It's like the cat problem. Go for the

1722
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,720
problem. Go for the cat. It's just go

1723
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:32,559
for the cat.

1724
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,799
>> Absolutely. You could get somebody there

1725
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:37,280
on time or you could get them there 30

1726
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:40,240
seconds late and take out a cat. Take

1727
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,799
out the cat. Less stray cats. Cats are

1728
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:44,319
horrible. Shout out to our cat ladies

1729
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:45,760
listening to the pod. There's I wonder

1730
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,799
how many cat ladies listen to this pod.

1731
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,160
I think there are a few.

1732
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:51,040
>> Oh, there are a few.

1733
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:54,400
>> Are there a few? Yeah, they hear from

1734
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,760
they're on blue sky talking about Oh,

1735
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,240
god. I had a joke. I'm not going to do

1736
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:01,359
it. All right. According to a Reuters

1737
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:06,160
report, Freeberg, China has built a

1738
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:09,119
prototype of ASML's EUV machine. Hey, if

1739
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:11,200
this is true, this report, it's uh it

1740
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:13,359
could have a profound impact on the AI

1741
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:15,040
race that we talked about. For those of

1742
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:18,079
you who don't know, ASML is the Dutch

1743
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:20,640
company worth $400 billion,

1744
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:22,559
22nd largest market cap in the world,

1745
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,960
and uh they are the only company that

1746
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:27,920
makes EUV machines, also called

1747
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:31,359
lithography. That stands for uh extreme

1748
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,960
ultraviolet. That's how you make H100s.

1749
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:35,520
Here's a photo of one of these giant

1750
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:38,319
machines. They cost $250 million to

1751
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:40,960
make, and they take 6 months to make,

1752
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:43,599
filled with all kinds of important

1753
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:45,119
parts. Carl Zeiss lenses, etc. Since

1754
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:47,200
2018,

1755
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:50,000
these machines have been limited for

1756
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:52,720
sale by the Dutch. Why? Why can't China

1757
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,680
buy these machines? Well, in 2018,

1758
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:57,599
Trump's Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo,

1759
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,160
put pressure on the Dutch to impose

1760
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:03,839
export controls on China. And uh later

1761
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:05,839
that same year, they did. So,

1762
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:07,359
according to Reuters in this news story,

1763
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:10,880
Freeberg,

1764
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:13,599
China used former ASML engineers

1765
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:16,400
allegedly to reverse engineer the

1766
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:18,400
machines. Reuters has pointed out that

1767
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,160
the machine in China has not yet

1768
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:24,079
produced any working chips. It's a

1769
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:26,240
prototype. The CCP is targeting 2028 uh

1770
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:28,400
for working chips. Some sources say

1771
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,799
maybe 2030 is more likely. You've been

1772
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:33,119
talking about China lithography on the

1773
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:35,200
show. We can play the Chariots of Fire

1774
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,960
music that Freeberg insists we play when

1775
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:40,000
he does his victory lap. Chimoth, here's

1776
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:43,760
his victory lap. Episode 224. Last year,

1777
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,880
China announced and began a 37 billion

1778
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:50,480
investment in developing their own

1779
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:52,559
3nanometer uh chimp technology. China

1780
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,920
made a claim that this investment they

1781
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:56,319
had made was starting to pay off and

1782
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,079
they had developed their own EUV system

1783
01:01:56,319 --> 01:02:00,240
and their big semiconductor companies

1784
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:02,880
called the semiconductor manufacturing

1785
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:05,359
international corporation or SMIC in

1786
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:08,240
China. They launched a seven nanometer

1787
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:09,599
chip with Huawei in their Mate 60 Pro,

1788
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,000
which is sort of like their iPhone

1789
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:13,520
competitor in China. And so they're

1790
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,839
proclaiming that they've already got

1791
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,119
this EUV technology. From what I

1792
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:18,720
understand, and Sax would know better

1793
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:21,760
than I, it sounds like there was a lot

1794
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:24,000
of reverse engineering and workound of

1795
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,880
existing technology in order to deliver

1796
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,280
that system.

1797
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:29,280
>> Who do you think has the best chance of

1798
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:32,720
challenging Nvidia? My early prediction

1799
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:35,200
for 2026 is Huawei where I think that

1800
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:37,520
there's lithography technology that

1801
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:39,359
exists in China that is not publicly

1802
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,799
discussed that is going to be deployed

1803
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,640
in Huawei and all these fabs that

1804
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:45,760
they're building in mainland China.

1805
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:46,319
>> So announcements 2026 impact 27 probably

1806
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,559
fair.

1807
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:52,400
>> Do you have first first on allin

1808
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:54,079
Freeberg? Congratulations on your weekly

1809
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,440
>> victory lap here. I don't I don't I

1810
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:57,119
honestly don't think that the Reuter

1811
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,640
story is necessarily news cuz I think

1812
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,920
it's a little bit of a narrow scope in

1813
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:02,240
trying to describe what happened which

1814
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,920
is that they quote stole ASML technology

1815
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,359
because scientists are working on it.

1816
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,960
That's not really the full scope of

1817
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:09,040
what's been going on in China for a

1818
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,040
number of years and it really

1819
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:13,520
understates the technological progress

1820
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:15,280
that China's independently made in using

1821
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:18,880
other systems to try and achieve

1822
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:20,480
lithography parody. So if you go back a

1823
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,640
number of years, the current kind of

1824
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:25,520
investment vehicle is actually Chinese

1825
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:29,280
banks put capital into a fund that's

1826
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:31,039
roughly $48 billion uh US dollars which

1827
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,119
is actually what's called the national

1828
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:36,720
integrated circuit industry investment

1829
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:39,359
fund phase 3. So there was phase 1 which

1830
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:41,520
started in 2014 which focused on

1831
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:44,720
manufacturing. So developing fabs with

1832
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:47,280
groups like SMIC. Phase two was stood up

1833
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:49,520
in 2019 which focused primarily on

1834
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:53,599
design and materials. And then this

1835
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:55,839
phase three fund was established in 2024

1836
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:57,440
explicitly to pivot to what they call

1837
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:59,839
choke points or bottlenecks in the

1838
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,839
manufacturing process. And state media

1839
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:04,160
has confirmed the existence of this

1840
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:06,319
phase 3 fund and the intentionality of

1841
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:08,640
the phase 3 fund to try and replicate

1842
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:10,400
lithography technology. Couple of months

1843
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,400
ago, if you pull up the link, Nick,

1844
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,160
here's a publication on this paper. So

1845
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,880
this is the leading research group out

1846
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:19,520
of China that's been backing into

1847
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:22,960
lithography technology using AIdriven

1848
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:24,960
systems. They published this paper which

1849
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:27,119
was a very good summary of where they

1850
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,720
are in July.

1851
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:30,880
Was this in nature? No, it's in light

1852
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,359
science and applications and this paper

1853
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:36,000
is called advancements and challenges in

1854
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:37,680
inverse lithography technology a review

1855
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
of artificial intelligence-based

1856
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:41,920
approaches. If you read into the paper

1857
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,760
and then you read the other publications

1858
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,640
from this particular research team at

1859
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:49,839
Singua University, they have made a

1860
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:51,920
number of breakthroughs in using AI to

1861
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:54,000
try and reestablish alternative systems

1862
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,440
and the traditional Zeiss optics and

1863
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
other control systems that are used in

1864
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,280
the ASML platform. And the way that

1865
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,880
they've done it, I I won't spend too

1866
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:03,200
much time on it, but there's a bunch of

1867
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:05,520
neural networks that they've used,

1868
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,680
trained, and have made discoveries from,

1869
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:09,760
including doing things like working with

1870
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:11,760
suboptimal optics, meaning you can have

1871
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,440
optics that have a degree of diffusion.

1872
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,640
And then how do you actually recreate

1873
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:19,680
3nmter printing techniques or 3nm masks

1874
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:21,680
by having shadowy effects accounted for

1875
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,119
in the AI? So, you almost like assume

1876
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,960
that the shadowy effects are going to

1877
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,319
come out and you print differently than

1878
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,680
you otherwise would. you don't need the

1879
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,960
degree of precision that you need and

1880
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,960
you don't necessarily need to go get the

1881
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,799
Zeiss optics. There was another paper

1882
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,720
that was published early this year by

1883
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:36,559
another Chinese research team that

1884
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:39,200
actually demonstrated how they did use

1885
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:41,520
AI to discover a novel method for doing

1886
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,200
optics. So there is a very broad and

1887
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:45,280
wellunded effort that's been underway

1888
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,640
for over a decade. But just in the last

1889
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,480
couple of years with artificial

1890
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:50,319
intelligence based approaches, they've

1891
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,160
made a series of breakthroughs. It is

1892
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:55,359
very likely the case that Huawei already

1893
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:56,799
has a lithography system that they'll be

1894
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:58,640
putting into production and this is why

1895
01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:00,480
I kind of talked about it when we were

1896
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,359
in Vegas and pointed it out earlier this

1897
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,119
year.

1898
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:04,640
>> But I again I think Reuters just sort of

1899
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,640
maybe caught on to some narrow segment,

1900
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:08,160
but this is a bigger story and a bigger

1901
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:11,440
set of progress that's been made over

1902
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:13,359
quite some time. ramification stacks

1903
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,240
here and and what you're thinking.

1904
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:18,160
Obviously, you've talked a bunch about,

1905
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,599
hey, let's sell our stack in there and

1906
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:21,839
they're clearly working on their own

1907
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:23,839
stack. What what's uh what's the

1908
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:25,839
ramification of this if it's true?

1909
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:28,400
>> Well, I've never supported selling EUV

1910
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:30,160
lithography to China. It is probably,

1911
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,079
>> you know, selling the stack of H1,

1912
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:34,319
whatever the previous Nvidia stack was.

1913
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:36,799
Yeah, EUV lithography. These machines

1914
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:39,760
that are made by ASML is probably our

1915
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:41,200
single biggest advantage in the AI race

1916
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,039
because they're the only machines that

1917
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:46,400
are capable of creating say 2 to 3

1918
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:48,160
nanometer chips, semiconductors, and

1919
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,680
it's sort of the perfect export control

1920
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,680
because there's only one company that

1921
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:54,400
makes these machines like you showed.

1922
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:56,960
They're gigantic. They're expensive. So

1923
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:58,480
if you think about like trying to put an

1924
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,839
export control on a commodity, there'd

1925
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,680
be a lot of ways to circumvent it

1926
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:03,680
because there's a lot of sources for a

1927
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,119
commodity. But in this case, there's

1928
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:07,280
literally only one company that makes

1929
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:08,960
these machines. So it's been a

1930
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:11,920
tremendous advantage, I'd say, for the

1931
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:14,799
West that we have EUV lithography. I'm

1932
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:16,319
not surprised that China is trying to

1933
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:19,200
reverse engineer it. It's kind of the

1934
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:21,839
obvious thing to do. No advantages

1935
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,920
forever. It does seem likely that at

1936
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:26,720
some point they'd be able to figure out

1937
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:29,920
how to do it. So I think that this

1938
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:31,839
article is not altogether a surprise in

1939
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:34,000
that sense. I mean I'm sure that China

1940
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:36,240
is trying really really hard to reverse

1941
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,240
engineer this. In the meantime, however,

1942
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:40,400
they've also made substantial progress

1943
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:44,000
with DUV lithography. So the previous

1944
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:48,319
generation of lithography before EUV was

1945
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:51,440
DUV. E is extreme. D is deep. In any

1946
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:54,960
event, DUV was supposed to sort of top

1947
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:56,720
out at say 14 nanometer chips and China

1948
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,960
was able to push the technology to get

1949
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:01,599
to 7 nanometer and now to five. So

1950
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,280
they've able to get a lot further using

1951
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:06,079
DUV lithography than anyone thought

1952
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:08,079
possible and that is why the Huawei

1953
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:09,599
chips, the Ascent chips are they're not

1954
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:12,559
as good as our chips, but they're

1955
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:14,799
serviceable and they've been able to use

1956
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:16,239
their prowess in networking to string

1957
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:19,839
more of them together. You have the

1958
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:22,799
cloud matrix 384 technology where Huawei

1959
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:26,080
will string together 384 of their Huawei

1960
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:30,319
Ascent chips into a rack and that will

1961
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:32,239
perform comparable to an Nvidia rack but

1962
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:34,400
using a lot more power. So the bottom

1963
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:36,000
line is China's been able to create a

1964
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:38,719
lot of these workarounds to our

1965
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,279
restrictions. But if they figured out

1966
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:43,600
how to reverse EUV that would be I'd say

1967
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:45,600
a blow because it is a real advantage

1968
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:48,159
for us. But I'm not convinced that this

1969
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,080
Reuter story is the the full picture. I

1970
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:51,199
think it's just a data point.

1971
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,199
>> Jim, any thoughts here?

1972
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:55,920
>> If you want a very short summary of how

1973
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:58,159
the last generation of chips work, the

1974
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:00,159
best way to think about this is that the

1975
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:03,040
most profitable and valuable chips to

1976
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:05,679
date have taken a very compute ccentric

1977
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:07,759
approach. That's why we've needed these

1978
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:11,440
ultra advanced process nodes. But the

1979
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:14,400
reality is that in a world of infinite

1980
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:16,880
inference, let's say the next generation

1981
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:19,199
of silicon will not take the same

1982
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,960
compute heavy approach and will probably

1983
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:23,600
rely on a much more memorycentric

1984
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:25,120
architecture that uses a lot of SRAM.

1985
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,960
The value of that is that you can

1986
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:30,480
produce these things as Sax said at 14

1987
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:33,440
nanometer at 75 all of these process

1988
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:34,960
nodes that are much less advanced that I

1989
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:37,199
actually think is the future. So, in a

1990
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:40,159
weird way,

1991
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:41,440
if they steal this, which I think we

1992
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:44,000
should assume they've already stole it

1993
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:45,759
quite honestly and they figured it out,

1994
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,839
the question is how bad is it? That's

1995
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:50,080
the really important question. And the

1996
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:52,799
thing about a more memory ccentric

1997
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:55,120
approach for AI inference or these next

1998
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:58,080
generation forms of silicon, it demands

1999
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:59,600
a lot more of compilers. It demands a

2000
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:01,440
lot more of the software. I still think

2001
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,640
that's where we are light years ahead.

2002
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,800
So, I don't think it's the end of the

2003
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,560
world and we're still in a very good

2004
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,880
place,

2005
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,520
but it is bad. Friberg, weren't we

2006
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:15,440
supposed to uh start onshoring with the

2007
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:18,000
chips act and maybe get trending towards

2008
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:20,239
having this production ability in

2009
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,719
America? And obviously that's been

2010
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:25,040
really hard to do.

2011
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,960
And China and their relationship with

2012
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,640
Taiwan seems to be and and the

2013
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,560
possibility that they actually take over

2014
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,400
Taiwan in a military fashion has been

2015
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,280
this existential concern or even

2016
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,880
short-term concern.

2017
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:38,480
>> Maybe it's a better way to say it. The I

2018
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,120
think the biggest security implication

2019
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:43,520
to consider at this moment is that both

2020
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:46,640
the US and mainland China are onshoring

2021
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:48,320
manufacturing and that makes Taiwan less

2022
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,600
of a strategic point of interest for the

2023
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,440
United States and for United States

2024
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,760
industry. Maybe one of the ways to think

2025
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:55,199
about the positive aspect of what is

2026
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,520
going on which is maybe call it the

2027
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:58,800
bulcanization of generally manufacturing

2028
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:01,760
but specifically semiconductor

2029
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:04,480
manufacturing in this case is reduced

2030
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:06,480
security concerns. So there's no longer

2031
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:08,400
this flash point perhaps in Taiwan. If

2032
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:10,480
China did invade Taiwan and the US had

2033
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:12,480
fab manufacturing, we're less likely to

2034
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:14,320
want to defend Taiwan. And frankly, if

2035
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,480
China has fabs on mainland, do they

2036
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:18,000
really need to invade Taiwan?

2037
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,239
>> What's the economic interest in doing

2038
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,920
so?

2039
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:21,440
>> Yeah, that's kind of where I was going

2040
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,199
with it. But if they also wanted to

2041
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:25,280
jumpstart Freedberg, they could just go

2042
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:27,600
to Taiwan and take the machines. Like,

2043
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:29,600
is that actually the plan?

2044
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,920
>> Like I I don't know what the CCP's plan

2045
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:33,679
is. I think that's a pretty um simple

2046
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,040
statement to make. I think just going to

2047
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:36,320
Taiwan is probably a lot more

2048
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,480
complicated than

2049
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:40,880
>> of course it is. My point is if this if

2050
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:42,800
this was super existential to get those

2051
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,800
chips for China and they go to Taiwan

2052
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,159
and they then they've reverse engineered

2053
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,679
the machine by default.

2054
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:49,920
>> We we need to recognize we keep using

2055
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:51,840
the term reverse engineering as if ASML

2056
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,920
is the only way to do this and it is

2057
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,520
not. If you read their papers and you

2058
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:57,360
read what's coming out, there are

2059
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,960
alternative production manufacturing

2060
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:01,360
methods and systems that are being

2061
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:03,120
developed in China that not only maybe

2062
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:04,960
provide parody to ASML, but get ahead of

2063
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,560
ASML. And I think this is really

2064
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,800
important to understand. China is not

2065
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:10,560
just in a catch-up race. They're in a

2066
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,080
primacy race and they are trying to

2067
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,600
develop privacy in lithography

2068
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:15,360
technology which will give them privacy

2069
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,280
in manufacturing which will give them

2070
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:19,360
primacy in AI which will give them

2071
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,719
economic leverage over the planet and

2072
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,239
that is very critical for us to

2073
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:24,080
understand. This is not about stealing

2074
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:25,360
data from ASML. Like, no one gives a

2075
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:27,199
[ __ ] If you're sitting in China, you're

2076
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:28,560
thinking about I've got the world's best

2077
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:30,640
scientists or some of the world's best

2078
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,840
scientists and I'm giving them the

2079
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,360
resources and I'm giving them the

2080
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,120
mandate to go solve this problem. The

2081
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:37,920
government, as I mentioned last year,

2082
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:39,840
put $40 billion against this problem and

2083
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,440
said, "Go figure it out." And these guys

2084
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:44,400
at Singa are publishing some

2085
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:47,199
groundbreaking research on how to do it.

2086
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:49,040
>> But it's easier to catch up or to copy

2087
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:50,880
than to innovate.

2088
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,960
So if you're China, the first thing

2089
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,880
you'd want to do is just copy EUV and

2090
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,000
get that technology for yourself.

2091
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,600
>> Well, let me ask you this. What would

2092
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,120
you do? So you're the AIAR. You're

2093
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,960
sitting in the United States and China's

2094
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,560
got this lithography technology. Is your

2095
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,679
goal to steal their technology or is

2096
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,719
your goal to get your best scientists

2097
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,679
and say, "Let's get ahead of their

2098
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:06,880
technology."

2099
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:08,960
>> If I'm China,

2100
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:10,640
>> neither are the United States.

2101
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,480
>> It's to solve the problem. What is the

2102
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,719
actual economic commercial problem we're

2103
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,080
solving?

2104
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:16,000
>> Right. So if you can figure out a way to

2105
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:18,000
do manufacturing better, cheaper, faster

2106
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,679
than the way the that China does it, you

2107
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,520
would obviously take that path. You're

2108
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:22,960
not trying to get to par with China, if

2109
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,280
you view yourself to be supreme to

2110
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,800
China,

2111
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,719
>> China. But you have to understand even

2112
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,440
with these EUV machines and the same is

2113
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:30,000
true in the other side

2114
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:31,679
>> at two or even sub 2 nanometer scale,

2115
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,280
you have these incredible laws of

2116
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:35,199
physics that you are pushing to the

2117
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:38,159
boundaries of which cause these chips to

2118
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:40,159
have pretty low yield. you have a lot of

2119
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:42,000
systems that actually aren't that

2120
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:44,640
efficient and highly utilized as a

2121
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,239
result. So these systems are brittle.

2122
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,840
The second thing is that when you have

2123
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:49,600
these compute- ccentric architectures,

2124
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,000
you end up making design decisions like

2125
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:53,600
HBM, they'll have to go and steal all

2126
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,719
the HBM which is the high bandwidth

2127
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:58,800
memory business that SKHix and Samsung

2128
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:00,880
have. But again, that's where Nvidia and

2129
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,400
then Google have an effective monopoly.

2130
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,320
>> Let me ask you a question, S. I mean,

2131
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,800
what's your strategic response if China

2132
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:08,640
next year goes into manufacturing? with

2133
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,560
a sub 2 nanometer system that's got

2134
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,000
higher yields, is faster, is cheaper

2135
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,199
than anything that we're seeing anywhere

2136
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,719
else in the world.

2137
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:16,239
>> Well,

2138
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:17,440
I don't think that's going to happen.

2139
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:19,679
Let's talk about that if it actually

2140
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:21,120
happens. I don't think it's going to.

2141
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:23,120
But what would I be focused on right

2142
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:26,480
now? I would say we want to get more of

2143
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:29,199
the leading edge manufacturing in the

2144
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:32,239
United States. TSMC has already opened a

2145
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:34,880
big fab in Arizona and they're planning

2146
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:37,520
on increasing the size of that and

2147
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:39,440
that's really important and we should

2148
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,040
get all these restrictions out of the

2149
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:43,199
way. They're facing all sorts of

2150
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,800
permitting restrictions. I mean all the

2151
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:46,719
stuff that Bernie is talking about where

2152
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:49,440
he wants to slow down. I mean he's

2153
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:50,880
talking about data centers but not

2154
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,120
>> manufacturing but the concepts are the

2155
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,760
same.

2156
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,239
>> Yeah. Roana, Elizabeth Warren, you've

2157
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,760
got

2158
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:57,440
>> exactly wrong. I mean,

2159
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:59,600
>> anti-che progress people saying, "Let's

2160
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:01,280
stop all this stuff." Meanwhile, China

2161
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,480
is not just racing to catch up, but

2162
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:04,080
they're likely going to get ahead of the

2163
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:05,280
United States. And if we're caught

2164
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,840
flatfooted because we've got a

2165
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:10,960
moratorium on development, a moratorium

2166
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:12,560
on production, it's going to be

2167
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,840
extraordinarily damaging,

2168
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:16,000
>> right? Well, look, this is where I agree

2169
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,760
with you is that if this Reuters report

2170
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,080
is accurate, it does speed up the

2171
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,840
timeline on China closing the chip gap

2172
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:23,679
from

2173
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,760
>> decades to a few years. You can go read

2174
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,880
the Singua papers. You'll see that these

2175
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,400
guys are so advanced.

2176
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,760
>> If they care about being ahead, why are

2177
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:31,120
they publishing that paper?

2178
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,719
>> So, by the way, this is a really

2179
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:34,159
important point and I've picked up on

2180
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:36,719
this from a number of different

2181
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:39,040
disciplines in scientific research. So,

2182
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:40,719
what's been going on is scientists in

2183
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:43,360
China, they're very smart people.

2184
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:45,040
There's very great scientists there. And

2185
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:47,120
like all scientists, they don't think

2186
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:49,120
necessarily in terms of nationalism

2187
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,800
first. They think in terms of science.

2188
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:53,280
They want to publish their research.

2189
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:56,000
They want to be known. They want to be

2190
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:58,239
the discoverers of these new frontiers

2191
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,640
and so they publish. And what we've seen

2192
01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:02,800
in several instances is that the

2193
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:04,640
scientific research groups will publish

2194
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,159
and they'll publish slightly ahead. And

2195
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:08,000
once they get ahead of the market or

2196
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:10,159
they get ahead of the world, suddenly

2197
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,080
they stop publishing. And it's almost

2198
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:14,960
like the CCP comes in and it's like,

2199
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,719
okay, you guys are now, you know, going

2200
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:18,960
too far. We don't want to tip our hat

2201
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:20,640
too far. And the stuff starts to recede.

2202
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:22,880
And I think there was this one paper on

2203
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:25,280
optics that is designed to replace the

2204
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,560
Zeiss monopoly in optics that suddenly

2205
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,840
disappeared and that research team

2206
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,000
stopped publishing. I got to find this

2207
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:31,280
paper. This came out last year.

2208
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,880
>> There are a number of these disciplines

2209
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,000
where there's publications that go to a

2210
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,760
certain extent and then they stop

2211
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,480
publishing. So I think that there's a

2212
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,320
little bit of a

2213
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:40,800
>> because of the funding cycle in China.

2214
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:42,880
You have every single local government

2215
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,560
that's given capital to invest in

2216
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:46,320
businesses and so they compete and

2217
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,520
compete until it gets to the state level

2218
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,199
and you have one or two national

2219
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,040
champions. But if this was so important,

2220
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:54,320
Freeberg, would there also be an

2221
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:57,440
argument to

2222
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:59,360
publish things that would send um that

2223
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:02,000
would be misinformation or send people

2224
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:03,679
down a wrong direction?

2225
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,800
>> No, because you have to again the

2226
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:09,600
funding cycle is you get as a policy

2227
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,960
person in Shanghai, you get promoted

2228
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,199
because you make a good bet.

2229
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:15,120
>> Yeah. No, but you so by the time it

2230
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:16,880
becomes a one national to Freeberg's

2231
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:20,560
point, when's the last time you saw BYD

2232
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:22,719
or CL publish anything meaningful,

2233
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,800
>> but when they were not the national

2234
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:26,719
champion, they were probably publishing

2235
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,480
very aggressively.

2236
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:30,320
But at that time, there was 50 different

2237
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:32,000
companies competing to be the national

2238
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:34,800
champion. So I suspect what's happening

2239
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:37,360
here is there's 50 different semi-

2240
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:38,560
startups all over China. Everybody's

2241
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:40,159
trying to support their own local

2242
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,679
version and eventually when there's one

2243
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:42,960
they disappear.

2244
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:45,199
>> Okay. Interesting.

2245
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:47,280
>> I mean, one of the things we see is

2246
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:50,159
China does give money to these research

2247
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:52,159
institutions on frontier science and

2248
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:53,920
then there's an industrialization. It's

2249
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:55,280
something the US isn't quite as good at.

2250
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,440
And I think it's again, we've talked

2251
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:59,679
about the co-opting of our universities

2252
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:01,360
as research institutions over the last

2253
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:03,760
couple of decades. They've become these

2254
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:05,280
sort of employment centers, if you will,

2255
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,280
and they've become these sort of weird

2256
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:09,520
social engineering systems. They've kind

2257
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:11,360
of gotten away from some of the core

2258
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,679
research or that that's been kind kind

2259
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:15,760
of co-opted. In China, there are these

2260
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:16,880
sort of dedicated research centers and

2261
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,640
then there are universities where

2262
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:20,719
there's very clear independent research

2263
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:22,080
that goes on on university campuses.

2264
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:24,000
They typically get quite a bit of

2265
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:26,239
funding. And the way this worked, if you

2266
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,760
look into the details of this China

2267
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:29,040
National Integrated Circuit Industry

2268
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,880
Investment Fund, and there were three

2269
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:32,400
funds, one, two, and three, the funds

2270
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:34,480
get bigger and bigger as the research

2271
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:36,000
teams make progress. Uh, it's a very

2272
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:38,239
smart way of doing things from a central

2273
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,239
planning perspective. And then in in

2274
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:42,239
phase three, they're now targeting these

2275
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:44,320
specific unlocks that then will enable

2276
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:45,760
industrialization. So they're funding

2277
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,120
some of this core research. The core

2278
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,800
research has these breakthroughs and

2279
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,239
then it gets industrialized. It's during

2280
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,679
that research phase where we see a lot

2281
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:53,840
of publications happening and this is

2282
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:55,440
happening in life sciences as well and

2283
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,480
in physics and in material science and

2284
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,640
as soon as they start to get a little

2285
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:00,080
bit ahead of the curve then it gets

2286
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,760
industrialized and the and the

2287
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:03,360
publications kind of stop. So I don't

2288
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:04,560
know if it's necessarily the CCP

2289
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,679
stepping in and saying hey stop

2290
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,199
publishing you're going to let the world

2291
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:08,800
know too much of what we're having

2292
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:10,880
versus okay the handoff is now happening

2293
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:13,040
and industrialization begins. Yeah,

2294
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:16,239
look, I would just say that to me the

2295
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:18,400
takeaway here is that the timeline on

2296
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:21,199
China closing the gap with us is being

2297
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:22,640
sped up. Whether it's the fact that

2298
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:24,320
they're copying what we're doing,

2299
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,560
whether EUV is being reverse engineered

2300
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:29,600
or maybe their scientists are figuring

2301
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:31,360
out a way to leaprog, we are in a pretty

2302
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,640
close race with China. And that's why I

2303
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:35,199
think it's really important that we

2304
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:36,960
don't listen to Bernie and others who

2305
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:38,480
just want to stop the progress because

2306
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:41,360
the progress is not going to stop. This

2307
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:43,040
is going to happen in China and that

2308
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,679
will be a big problem for the United

2309
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,560
States.

2310
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:46,560
>> All right, speaking of

2311
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:48,000
socialism/communism,

2312
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:49,280
uh you guys thinking about coming to

2313
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Austin, my neck of the woods.

2314
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:53,760
>> I've been uh pulling up these photos in

2315
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,120
Austin of these homes.

2316
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,880
>> You know I'm doing it right.

2317
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,840
>> Welcome to Texas, boys.

2318
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,520
>> Like on the lake.

2319
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,960
>> Sachs already bought a house. Sachs

2320
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:03,040
already bought a house.

2321
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,880
>> He hooked me up with the uh agent.

2322
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:06,560
>> What does she got you looking at?

2323
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,000
>> I'm not sure yet. We're just

2324
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,480
>> You guys are bidding against each other,

2325
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,400
[ __ ]

2326
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:11,760
>> You can have my sloppy seconds.

2327
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,199
>> You have the high ground, so you can

2328
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:16,239
negotiate hard.

2329
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:19,520
>> Uh there is so much inventory, but only

2330
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:21,440
like 20% of the inventory is on the MLS.

2331
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:24,320
80% here because it's a no reporting

2332
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:25,679
state is off market. So, it's completely

2333
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,679
different than

2334
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:29,280
>> any other market. Certainly California.

2335
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:31,040
>> I want to be on the lake. Like, if I'm

2336
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:33,280
going to do this on the water,

2337
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:35,120
>> Oh, really? I don't want the lake. I

2338
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,640
mean, if you're here, here's the

2339
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:39,679
challenge with the lake. People are

2340
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:41,840
going to come up to your house and take

2341
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:43,440
pictures and hang out like 2 feet off

2342
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,679
your house and starting at 7 a.m.

2343
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:47,280
>> Texas house in San Francisco.

2344
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:49,120
>> Everybody's zipping around the lake in

2345
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,679
motorboats starting at 7 a.m. It's

2346
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:52,640
beautiful.

2347
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:55,440
>> I love your thing. It's great, but just

2348
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:56,480
>> understand it's going to get loud at 7

2349
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:58,239
a.m.

2350
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:00,000
>> There's nothing a good motorboating

2351
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:02,719
doesn't

2352
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,800
>> Who doesn't love a good motorboat?

2353
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:06,239
Jal, I heard you're like an hour away.

2354
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:08,239
You're not even in Austin.

2355
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:09,679
>> I I'm in the Hill Country on my ranch,

2356
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:11,679
but we're getting a place closer to the

2357
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:13,199
city, actually. So, we're 30 minutes

2358
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:14,880
outside the city.

2359
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:16,320
>> 30 minutes? My god.

2360
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,000
>> I heard you're

2361
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,440
>> I heard you're in the sticks.

2362
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,040
>> No, not that far. Not that far.

2363
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:23,440
>> No, he's in the suburbs of the suburbs.

2364
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:25,440
>> No, if you want to have like, you know,

2365
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,159
dozens of acres, you can't do that in

2366
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,600
the city.

2367
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:30,560
>> When I was growing up in Memphis, they

2368
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,120
called that Bumble Egypt.

2369
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,560
BF

2370
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:34,960
>> Bumble.

2371
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:37,280
>> I mean, if you want a ranch and you want

2372
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:39,920
like dozens of acres, you can't do that

2373
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,960
in You can get an acre to three acres

2374
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,840
inside of the city.

2375
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:46,000
>> I found an acre in Terry Town.

2376
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,640
>> An acre is doable. Two acres is

2377
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,480
possible.

2378
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:50,239
>> You know what's so sad? Even if this

2379
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,480
bill doesn't get on the books, which I

2380
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,199
think

2381
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,360
>> everyone's leaving,

2382
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:55,920
>> there's a decent chance it ripped the

2383
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:58,239
band-aid off, the revenues of California

2384
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:00,639
are going to plummet.

2385
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:03,360
plummet.

2386
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:05,520
>> Man, it is um yeah, I mean we saw the

2387
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:08,400
writing on the wall. Socialism is coming

2388
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:10,320
and you know this one of the great

2389
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:12,000
things about having a United States of

2390
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:14,000
America that different states can

2391
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,639
optimize for different things.

2392
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,400
>> The thing here

2393
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:18,719
>> that one bill this proposed billionaire

2394
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:22,320
tax has singlehandedly changed the

2395
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:24,400
trajectory of the California economy by

2396
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:26,719
a hundred to$200 billion dollars over

2397
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:29,760
the next 5 to 10 years. It's an enormous

2398
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:32,400
cell phone. People were here willing to

2399
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,679
pay the money and now

2400
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,120
>> Yeah, people were willing to put up with

2401
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:36,960
a lot in this state.

2402
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:38,719
>> As soon as you tell people, "Hey, we're

2403
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,639
we're doing property seizures,

2404
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:42,239
>> property seizures or their threat of

2405
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:44,000
property seizures or the fact that

2406
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:45,760
people didn't come out against property

2407
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,239
seizures is enough for everyone to be

2408
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:50,000
like, "See you see you later." The fact

2409
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:51,440
that all the politicians didn't in

2410
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,639
uniform stand up and say, "This is

2411
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:55,040
ridiculous. We're never going to let

2412
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:57,520
this happen." They let this happen by

2413
01:22:55,040 --> 01:23:00,480
not defending the property rights that

2414
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:01,920
are endowed in this country. They lost

2415
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,880
everything.

2416
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,800
>> They had to defend it.

2417
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:06,320
>> What do you think happens to the state

2418
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,120
budget over the next four or five years

2419
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,560
as a result of this?

2420
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,840
>> You're right. It's trash. And by the

2421
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,520
way, and that that's what drives the

2422
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,120
socialist spiral because then they try

2423
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,000
and do more property seizures and they

2424
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,440
try and get the money back.

2425
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,239
>> Who are they going to tax? Everybody's

2426
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,679
going to be gone now.

2427
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:19,360
>> And here's the other crazy statistic

2428
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:20,639
that we never talk about. I was going to

2429
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,159
try and put some data together and get

2430
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:24,719
it as a topic, but we should save it for

2431
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:27,120
the new year. But the California pension

2432
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:29,520
fund system is underfunded by roughly a

2433
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:31,040
trillion dollars. So these folks in the

2434
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,280
California pension fund system are

2435
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:35,360
sitting around waiting for money to come

2436
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:38,239
to them every year for the next 30, 40,

2437
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:39,760
50 years and the money isn't there.

2438
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:41,760
They're guaranteed that money from this

2439
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,440
pension fund system and it's not there.

2440
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,600
What are they going to do? It's a

2441
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:47,520
trillion dollars short. That's a state

2442
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,360
obligation. Why would anybody hear

2443
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:53,040
something like that and think giving

2444
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:54,880
politicians more money is a good idea?

2445
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:56,480
These people are so fiscally

2446
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:58,159
irresponsible. They're fiscally

2447
01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:00,480
illiterate.

2448
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:03,520
There is that

2449
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:08,719
it's pretty clear to me that in New York

2450
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:11,440
and California it'll be 60 plus% taxes.

2451
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:13,920
And you know, if you were living in a

2452
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:17,120
perfect society that appreciated it and

2453
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:20,480
you had this incredible safety, you had

2454
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:21,760
extraordinary schools and the roads and

2455
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,719
the public transit,

2456
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,159
>> everything worked.

2457
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:26,639
>> Yeah. Like Japan,

2458
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:28,639
>> you'd pay 60%, you would be ecstatic.

2459
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:30,960
>> Yeah. You'd be like, "Okay, I mean, it's

2460
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:32,639
a lot, but hey, this is a pretty great

2461
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:34,719
place to live." If you're paying that

2462
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:38,080
and people are breaking into your home

2463
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:39,600
and there's nine overdoses a day, you're

2464
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,560
like, "Wait a second." And then on top

2465
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,080
of that, by the way,

2466
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,800
>> and they're seizing your private

2467
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:43,840
property now.

2468
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,199
>> Seizing your property.

2469
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:47,679
>> They're seizing your property. And by

2470
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:49,679
the way, they don't care about you when

2471
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:52,080
it when you look at the laws. I was just

2472
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:53,840
talking to some law enforcement people.

2473
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:56,800
>> City's using your money to give homeless

2474
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:58,480
people vodka. It's just

2475
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,840
>> Well, I mean, if it was tequila, I mean,

2476
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,440
I have a good tequila brand we could

2477
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:02,239
give to the homeless. Maybe we can make

2478
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:02,880
a deal.

2479
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:04,719
>> Yeah.

2480
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:08,080
>> Shout out to all at Gaya coming to you.

2481
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:10,960
Uh to delivery is happening right now.

2482
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:14,000
Um, in all seriousness, I was talking to

2483
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:16,719
some security folks um and was talking

2484
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:20,719
to my security guy in Cal who's a in

2485
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:22,000
California and um in California, not

2486
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:23,840
only do they not have the castle

2487
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,440
doctrine, they've replaced the castle

2488
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,920
doctrine where you can like defend your

2489
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:30,960
home if somebody comes into it with your

2490
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:32,800
gun uh and protect your family and your

2491
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:36,480
property.

2492
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:39,679
Now you have to have this um duty to

2493
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:41,920
flee. So you have to be able to run out

2494
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:44,560
of your home with your family as opposed

2495
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:46,080
to defend your family. So they literally

2496
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,840
are telling the criminals, "Hey, listen.

2497
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:49,760
If you break into somebody's home in

2498
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,600
California, don't worry about getting

2499
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,520
shot. You they're going to have to run

2500
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:56,639
out or else they're in the wrong." Like

2501
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:58,800
this is deranged. The the inmates have

2502
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:00,639
literally taken over the asylum. They

2503
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,960
they have taken over the asylum. I I

2504
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:05,600
realized this two years ago and I pulled

2505
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:06,719
the rip cord. Some Elon realized it six

2506
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,719
years ago when he tried to build a

2507
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:10,960
factory. He pulled the rip cord. You

2508
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:12,719
guys are realizing it now. Everybody's

2509
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:14,960
realizing this. New York uh the hedge

2510
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:16,719
fund guys in New York and in Jersey and

2511
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:18,080
Connecticut. They realized it. What?

2512
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:19,520
>> Only Hollywood guys. I know a bunch of

2513
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:21,760
Hollywood guys leaving.

2514
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:24,239
>> Yeah. I literally this producer, one of

2515
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:25,920
the major producers who has produced

2516
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:27,520
billions of dollars worth of films came

2517
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:29,760
here last year. I met him at a football

2518
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:31,760
game. He said, "Tell me everything." I

2519
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,880
told him everything. He moved here. He

2520
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:35,120
moved here. He's going to start making

2521
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:37,280
movies here. And he is one of the top

2522
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:39,679
top I won't say who he is, but you know

2523
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:41,760
his films because his partner who is an

2524
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:44,400
incredibly high-profile comedian, like

2525
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:46,400
amongst the highest profile in history,

2526
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:49,040
where they make films together, he moved

2527
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:51,199
here. Why? He he doesn't want to live in

2528
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:53,520
LA and risk his family's life to an home

2529
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:55,120
invasion and and the house burning down

2530
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,120
because they don't fill water in the

2531
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:59,120
reservoir. I mean, guys,

2532
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:02,480
>> hopefully not everyone realizes it cuz I

2533
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:04,560
need to sell my house to someone.

2534
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:06,880
>> Good luck. You'll be okay. You'll be

2535
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:07,840
okay. There's a Chinese billionaire.

2536
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,639
>> Actually, you know, you know who you'll

2537
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,920
be able to sell your house.

2538
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:10,800
>> There's no billionaires left in

2539
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:12,960
California.

2540
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:15,440
>> It's whoever uh the politicians are that

2541
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,400
are able to aggregate power and money in

2542
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,080
the socialist.

2543
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,960
>> Gavin will buy your house and turn it

2544
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:21,760
into a home.

2545
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:23,040
>> Gavin's gone. You guys are going to look

2546
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:26,560
You guys are going to look back on Gavin

2547
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:28,639
and realize he was the most uh

2548
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:30,400
>> upstanding moderate governor that

2549
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:32,080
California had in modern era and

2550
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,760
suddenly we're going to be like what the

2551
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,199
>> and I think that's a great place to stop

2552
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:37,040
it, boys.

2553
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:39,520
>> We will be doing a couple of episodes

2554
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:42,400
between now and the end of the year and

2555
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:44,080
uh yeah, no weeks off. Hopefully we get

2556
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:46,800
to see each other over the holidays.

2557
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:49,199
I'll see you Saxs uh and you as well

2558
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:50,480
Jimath and Freedberg shortly. Oh, by the

2559
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:52,800
way, the president just signed an

2560
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:55,520
executive order reclassifying marijuana

2561
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:59,120
from schedule one to schedule three.

2562
01:27:55,520 --> 01:28:01,360
>> Schedule one to schedule three. Okay. Uh

2563
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:02,880
that's something Obama wanted to do in

2564
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:04,400
the second term and never did. So,

2565
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:06,159
>> I think it's a good thing. I mean,

2566
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,760
schedule one is like heroin. You know,

2567
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:09,520
it just never made sense to treat it the

2568
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,560
same as heroin. You know, I know a lot

2569
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,080
of people aren't thrilled about

2570
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,880
marijuana. It's not great when people

2571
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,400
are in the

2572
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:15,040
>> I don't like marijuana, but I I agree

2573
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,120
with this.

2574
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:19,440
>> It's not heroin.

2575
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:21,600
I mean it would be on I think most

2576
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:23,199
people intellectually would put it on

2577
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,880
the same level as alcohol, right?

2578
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:26,960
>> I just want it studied so that we can

2579
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:28,560
have toxicity labels. That's the big

2580
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,280
thing that I want because like if these

2581
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,159
kids

2582
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,239
>> Yeah.

2583
01:28:30,159 --> 01:28:33,679
>> That's the most important thing is put a

2584
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:35,040
tox label on these things so you know

2585
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:37,840
what you're taking.

2586
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:39,520
>> It's the the strength of these things

2587
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:41,920
over the last 50 years has changed

2588
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:46,159
dramatically. And there are Yeah. There

2589
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:48,000
there there are these um shards they

2590
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:50,159
create of this like incredibly intense

2591
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,560
THC that will make you like go

2592
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:55,199
psychotic. Like it's really dangerous.

2593
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:57,199
So the smoking a joint from our youth is

2594
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:59,600
very different than smoking these like

2595
01:28:57,199 --> 01:29:01,520
resins and stuff that they've created

2596
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,280
apparently that are like a 100 times the

2597
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:05,040
potency 200 times potency and they can

2598
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,760
put you in a psychotic state. Really

2599
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,120
dangerous folks.

2600
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:09,440
>> Oh that's that's where like the FDA

2601
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:12,400
should regulate it. More like alcohol or

2602
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:14,159
something. 100%. Much better process,

2603
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,880
especially since kids are getting messed

2604
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:16,800
up. Yeah.

2605
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:18,480
>> All right, everybody. Another amazing
