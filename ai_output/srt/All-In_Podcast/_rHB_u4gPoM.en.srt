1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,639
Peter Teal said this best. He's like,

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,240
"Look at all the money that's going into

3
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,920
AI. There's really only one company

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,839
that's making any money, and that's

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,280
Nvidia." Like, at this point, the jury's

6
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,559
still out. We don't even know what AI

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,920
is. It's sort of like when the internet

8
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,519
was happening, everyone thought these

9
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,880
fiber optic switch companies were going

10
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,480
to make all the money. Turns out that

11
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,760
was wrong. It was the end applications

12
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,439
that made all the money. And they

13
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,000
competed in many different markets from

14
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,760
Google to Amazon to Uber. You can go

15
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,160
down the list of all the beneficiaries

16
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,439
of the core infrastructure technology of

17
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,439
the internet that was built out. So,

18
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,599
what is really going on? Well, AI is the

19
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,480
new lightning rod for fear and for

20
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,480
divisiveness that ultimately breeds

21
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,320
compliance and control, which is where

22
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,160
these politicians are trying to drive

23
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,920
the populace and the voting conditions

24
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,200
in the United States. And that's what's

25
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,120
going on right now. There's a lot of

26
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,039
fear about putting this data center in

27
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,039
my town is going to do X or Y or Z with

28
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,800
no real conversation about the truth of

29
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,640
that matter. There's a lot of fear about

30
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,640
wealth creation being aggregated in the

31
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,239
hand of a few when, as we saw with the

32
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,640
internet, it benefited the many. And

33
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,399
that fear mongering is a very similar

34
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,559
tactic that we've seen in the prior

35
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,040
generations where policies were

36
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,280
misstated, fear was used, and then

37
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,799
voting control allowed folks to come to

38
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,080
power that were looking for power. So, I

39
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,159
think it's just the lightning rod at the

40
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,159
moment.
