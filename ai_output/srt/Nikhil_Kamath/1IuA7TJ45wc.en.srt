1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,279
Tamil ladu 85% of the market is brandy

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,839
98% of the brandy sells in south

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,759
>> why is that

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,000
>> in south people are very religious if

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,920
you see pondi and kerala plus tamiladu

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,920
so one is pondi had the French

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,679
connection and French are into brandy

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,600
second earlier like the brandy was

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,199
called doctor's brandy so people used to

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,359
think that they'll drink because of

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,279
health purpose religious purpose doctor

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,039
like in north India if you see when we

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,560
were kids when it was very cold our

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,400
mothers used to like you know rub brandy

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,560
on our hand so I think it's just some

16
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,200
kind of that else South India it's like

17
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,200
hot etc. But the brandy market there is

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,200
huge.
