Hello everyone.

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,640
Amazing.

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,520
I've created a leading [music]

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,079
ingredients project the next 10 years

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,160
growth rate. India is best. I think

14
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,120
India over the next 10 years [music] has

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,120
all the ingredients to really be the

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,210
strongest growth rate and and an

improvement. [music]

>> youngster in India who's 25 years old,

20
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,479
how does he make money?

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,880
>> Two things I'd suggest. First, play the

22
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,920
game. Find a game that you [music] love

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,840
and then be around people who are pros

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,280
at playing the game so you can chat

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,280
about it. That's a good path.

26
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,600
How do you view crypto and the world of

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,520
Bitcoin or even like stable coin? Tell

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,119
me this. If you were to back

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,720
>> You got to give me one question at a

30
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,240
time. Yeah.

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,891
>> Okay, let's do Bitcoin and then we're

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,891
stable coin. [music]

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:05,200
Hi Rey. Uh thank you for doing this. As

34
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,080
a trader myself, I've been trading now a

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,000
long time about 21 years. I think there

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,560
will be a lot I can learn from you and

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,840
many others back home in India like me

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,640
can also learn from you. If I can

39
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:23,360
contextualize the audience we are

40
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,440
talking to today, they are young Indian

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,920
wannabe entrepreneurs

42
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,599
uh investors, want to be traders, people

43
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,160
who want to make a living in the stock

44
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,080
markets. I would say between the ages of

45
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,080
18 and 30.

46
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,760
>> Wonderful. That's that's exactly um the

47
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,840
group that I would like to speak to at

48
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,280
this stage in my life because I've

49
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,680
learned a lot and I would just want to

50
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,000
pass what I've learned along to those

51
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,560
people. So, thank you for allowing me to

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,720
do that.

53
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,280
>> No, thank you for doing this.

54
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,680
Everybody knows you, but if we could go

55
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,000
through like the big events of your life

56
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,720
and very briefly just to set context

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,560
again, could you tell us how you look at

58
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,800
your life from the very beginning from

59
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,440
when you were younger up until today?

60
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:16,000
>> Okay.

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:21,040
Um, my dad was a jazz musician. My mom

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,800
uh was a sort of say it mom. Uh I was

63
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,959
raised in u I didn't have any brothers

64
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,480
or sisters.

65
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:34,239
Um

66
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:38,080
it was a loving family. Um it was um not

67
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,640
poor. Not there was lower middle class.

68
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:45,760
Um I

69
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:48,319
did jobs when I was young. Uh I one of

70
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,319
those jobs was catting for at a golf

71
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,480
course and because I cattied at a golf

72
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,920
course at the time when there was a

73
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,959
stock market. Boom. The people I cied

74
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,560
with I would have conversations with and

75
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,920
I took the money I earned $6 a bag. I

76
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,480
carried two bags $12 for a round. When I

77
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,080
got $50 I would put it in the stock

78
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,000
market. And so I started um playing

79
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,600
around in the stock market much like

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,199
you're describing our audience does. And

81
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,160
um the first stock I bought I bought

82
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,240
only because it was the only company I

83
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,440
ever heard of that was selling for less

84
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,600
than $5 a share. And I thought, well

85
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,919
then I can buy more shares, so if it

86
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,400
goes up, I'll make more money. Which of

87
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,919
course made no sense. But it was a

88
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,960
company that uh was about to go

89
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:48,800
bankrupt, but another company acquired

90
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:52,479
it and it tripled in value and I thought

91
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,160
this is easy. It's not easy, but I got

92
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,320
hooked on the markets at 12.

93
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,000
>> Do you think it's like that? I I often

94
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,639
think about this. There was a really

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,120
tiny when I was 17, I bought this

96
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,840
company called Marsoft, a defunct

97
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,639
software company in India and the share

98
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,240
price again doubled or tripled. The

99
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,160
first experience of the stock market.

100
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,440
The people who tend to continue are the

101
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,560
ones who get lucky. Do you think so?

102
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,560
>> I think positive reinforcement works.

103
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,240
Negative reinforcement. Sure.

104
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,720
>> If you lost money on your first trade,

105
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,960
you would never have done it. Maybe

106
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,880
>> probably, you know, you put your hand on

107
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,360
a hot stove and it takes How many times

108
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,000
do you do that and then you react to it?

109
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,919
So, I can't say for sure, but probably.

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,479
But I got into the game,

111
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,759
>> right?

112
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,120
>> It was a game and it was it's a great

113
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,039
game.

114
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,280
>> If you play it, you think of it as a

115
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,720
game and that if you play it well, that

116
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,880
pays you money.

117
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,320
>> Do you think the stock market has

118
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,960
emotion? Does it treat you a certain way

119
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,440
at the beginning?

120
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,600
>> I I think it's unemotional. We are

121
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,320
emotional

122
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,120
and we certainly have emotions. N that's

123
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,639
one of the reasons the way I learn to

124
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,280
invest

125
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,880
uh was to write down my criteria when I

126
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,800
was making a decision. Every time I'd

127
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,919
make a decision,

128
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,560
I would then think why am I making that

129
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,560
decision? And then I write down the

130
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,960
criteria and see how it would have

131
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,560
worked in the past. It took me a while

132
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,440
to do this

133
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,800
>> because of my experiences and also you

134
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,560
know when you're wrestling with

135
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,840
positions particularly a position that

136
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,840
goes against you. Yeah.

137
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,400
>> You know you're wondering am I missing

138
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,199
something and then how old do how long

139
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:45,039
do I hold that position and what do I

140
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:48,880
do? So emotions and intellect and lack

141
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:52,160
of perspective is a pom. So when you

142
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,759
have a decision rule that then you know

143
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,319
how it would have worked all through

144
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,720
time. Now you're just playing that

145
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,400
decision rule and it helps you know.

146
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,520
>> Did you trade on leverage at the very

147
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,599
beginning?

148
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,160
>> Um I didn't trade on leverage in the

149
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,080
beginning but I bought in the beginning

150
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,599
very early in my age I bought futures

151
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,080
cuz it wouldn't give me leverage.

152
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,039
>> Yeah.

153
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,000
>> Okay. I decided very nobody traded

154
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,199
futures right.

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,120
>> Okay. there were no commodities. It just

156
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,360
very little. Okay. But I realized that

157
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,120
it would give me leverage.

158
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,759
>> And so I figured if I was going to be

159
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,759
good in the markets, I would want to do

160
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,280
have that leverage because I'd make more

161
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,800
money. So that's what drew me to.

162
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,680
>> Was it about four or five times

163
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,080
leverage?

164
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,000
>> Well, it was the futures contracts.

165
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,800
>> The margin requirement would be about 15

166
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,039
20%.

167
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,360
>> Yeah. And that would be a good demo,

168
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,440
>> right?

169
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,960
>> Odd one. Yeah. And what kind of

170
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,280
contracts were you trading in the very

171
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,800
beginning?

172
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,000
>> Well, then it was commodities,

173
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,400
>> right?

174
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,759
>> Okay. So, then it was um

175
00:07:52,400 --> 00:08:00,800
um everything from precious metals to

176
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:03,840
cattle where I got really into grain and

177
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,280
uh livestock and

178
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:11,599
um you know those types of commodities.

179
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,120
So when I uh so my background okay you

180
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,199
wanted a couple of stories so I'll give

181
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,720
you the stories.

182
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:22,560
So I did this and I went to college and

183
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:26,720
then um what was a defining moment my

184
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:30,560
learning experience was um I the year I

185
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,279
graduated from college 1971

186
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,959
I clerked on the floor of the New York

187
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,240
Stock Exchange

188
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,320
>> and this is before I went to graduate

189
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:46,240
school so it was in the summer

190
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:49,519
>> and on August 15th 197 71, President

191
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,640
Nixon defaulted on his obligation, the

192
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,440
US's obligation to give gold paper

193
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,240
money.

194
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,480
>> You know, back then, gold was money. The

195
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,360
paper money was like checks in a

196
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,600
checkbook.

197
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,120
>> Did he default or did he say that he

198
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,839
will no longer back the dollar with

199
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,720
gold?

200
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,240
>> I don't know the difference. [laughter]

201
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,519
>> The way you say it, there was a promise

202
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,080
that you could bird in, take $35, get an

203
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,560
ounce of gold. Then he said, "You can't

204
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,920
take your $35 to get an ounce of gold."

205
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,440
So that to me is

206
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,560
>> and that was because of Vietnam and

207
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,320
going to the moon.

208
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,800
>> Well, because we were spending a lot

209
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,200
more. This is the thing through history.

210
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,880
>> Yeah,

211
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,959
>> we always have to look at this. We'll

212
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,760
get into this, I'm sure, but through

213
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,519
history back to the Old Testament and

214
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,480
everything, the years of Jubilee and so

215
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:40,320
on, it's when there is a lot of claims

216
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,200
on money and there's not enough money in

217
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,320
the bank.

218
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,279
>> Mhm. Okay. And that's happened

219
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,880
throughout history. So we have a central

220
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:53,440
bank that was that started in 1913

221
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,440
and the idea was it had gold and there

222
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,480
were many more claims on the gold than

223
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,399
there was gold in the bank because for

224
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,880
the same reason you borrow a lot of

225
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,040
money and when you borrow a lot of money

226
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,959
and a lot more one man's debts are

227
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,279
another man's assets. So they're holding

228
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,839
it expecting that they can get the money

229
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,680
and then they want the money but there's

230
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,720
not enough money. And that was the

231
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,000
Federal Reserve Bank's problem in 1971.

232
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,399
>> What is money?

233
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,560
>> What is money? Money is money is a

234
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,200
medium of exchange and a storehold of

235
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,720
wealth. Very important to to recognize

236
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,240
it as a storehold of wealth. What is a

237
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,760
storehold of wealth? Okay. So when you

238
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,040
um in India many people realize that

239
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,560
gold is a storehold of wealth. Now what

240
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,440
we uh and then we p it's the perception

241
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,079
of money

242
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,120
>> that it can be used as a medium of

243
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,360
exchange that I can go around the world

244
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,200
>> and I can go from one country to another

245
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,920
and I can turn it in and get value to be

246
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,360
able to buy things. Right? So that is

247
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:05,120
what it is. Um and through history, gold

248
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:08,399
has been the most used money, most

249
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,959
accepted around the world. Um you know,

250
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,760
then when uh but it's the perception of

251
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,480
it. And so when we think about let's say

252
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,040
money as we commonly think about it,

253
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,320
which is fiat money, then that

254
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,560
>> but there's a difference there, right?

255
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,560
Like gold is a asset which is not a

256
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,240
liability on anyone else's book.

257
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,720
>> Exactly. It's a money.

258
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,360
>> It's the only money. Well, maybe it's

259
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,040
not. We could talk about crypto is

260
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:39,360
crypto, but yes, gold is the only money

261
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:42,079
that you can have and nobody has to give

262
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,320
you anything to have it.

263
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,720
>> Yeah. Other money, all other money is

264
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,839
dependent on somebody giving you

265
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,800
something. Okay? Whether they give you

266
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:56,240
and so it's unique in that it's

267
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,240
confiscation risk is less than others.

268
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,800
So that's why one of the reasons gold is

269
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,680
unique but it is also back to your main

270
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,320
point main point it is a widely

271
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,200
recognized storehold of wealth that I

272
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,839
could bring around the world and I could

273
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:16,399
uh use it and it's particularly

274
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:18,480
important in um that it is not deflate

275
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,040
uh you can't deflate its value but you

276
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,040
can't print it you create more of it and

277
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,880
then it also in order to hold its

278
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,079
>> I have a personal question here I hold a

279
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:32,480
lot of gold I for a long time have kept

280
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:35,920
10% of my asset base in gold. U the

281
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,519
thing I wonder with gold is while it

282
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,120
can't be replicated today. I mean there

283
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,200
are people who are talking it about it

284
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,800
as a byproduct of fusion and how they

285
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,399
will create it like they did lab grown

286
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,800
diamonds. I I don't want to extrapolate

287
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,079
that far.

288
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,000
But with gold isn't it based on faith?

289
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,560
Isn't it a bit like religion? Because

290
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,839
gold inherently I get that it's a great

291
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,920
place to store value but does gold have

292
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,959
enough utility in isolation?

293
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,880
>> I money doesn't have much utility

294
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,279
generally speaking right if you're

295
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,440
carrying around cash

296
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,360
it's paper it doesn't have much utility.

297
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,519
So I don't think it's utility. I think

298
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,120
you got to get out of the utility

299
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:20,480
perspective of gold. Um every go every

300
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,600
thing that's money could be a risk. Does

301
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,760
it stay money? So for example in the

302
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,720
history of gold when there were great

303
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,040
discoveries of gold then the value of

304
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,839
gold is affected by the quantity of

305
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,639
those discoveries and if they could

306
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,600
replicate gold or like they'd been

307
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,880
replicating diamonds then that becomes a

308
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,440
risk of gold. So there are all risks to

309
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,240
all monies and that are of a similar

310
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,079
nature in terms of uh replicating the

311
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,720
the supply of them or also um the

312
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:58,399
acceptance of them as a money. You know

313
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,040
there became um gold fell out of fashion

314
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,680
>> as a money and bonds fell into fashion.

315
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,639
But the historic thing to know is that

316
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,839
throughout history there is always the

317
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,920
temptation uh when when when you uh

318
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,240
there's a fiat money which easily could

319
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,040
be produced and then there's the

320
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,440
temptation of the interest rate.

321
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,519
>> Mhm.

322
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,320
>> Okay. Gold doesn't have an interest

323
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,440
rate.

324
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,560
>> Okay. No interest rate

325
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,320
>> in India it does.

326
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,360
>> Oh gold has an interest rate.

327
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,839
>> Uh so India doesn't produce very much

328
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,480
gold of our own. we end up importing a

329
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,600
lot of the gold. So to be fiscally

330
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,680
prudent, the government has this plan

331
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,079
where if you buy sovereign gold bonds

332
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,519
from the government, digital gold bonds,

333
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,800
>> yeah, you get a you get that ain't

334
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,720
>> gold,

335
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,880
>> but you're also able to monetize

336
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,440
physical gold because you can lend it

337
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,800
out for a certain percentage.

338
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,760
>> But you're still dealing with credit

339
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,480
risk.

340
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,240
>> Okay?

341
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,120
>> So what you're getting paid for is

342
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,360
credit risk, right? So it's not gold.

343
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,240
It's a promise to get your gold back,

344
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,680
>> right? Then that's what money was. And

345
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,320
that's why it would have an interest

346
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,480
rate. You have an interest rate that on

347
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,000
the promise to get your gold back.

348
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,079
That's what everybody believed. And

349
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,320
that's the great trick through history.

350
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,279
The great trick of history and everybody

351
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:23,120
believed it back then for a long time is

352
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,920
I if I hold the promise to get the gold

353
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,480
then I will get an interest rate and I

354
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,920
could always turn my money in for gold.

355
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,720
So why won't I hold the promise to get

356
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,880
the gold and get an interest rate on it

357
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,040
rather than to hold the actual gold

358
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,440
which wouldn't give me an interest rate.

359
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,320
And that was the trap and that is always

360
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,199
the trap. So when you look at it today,

361
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:51,279
let's say and you you think okay I I

362
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,920
think it's just arbitrage. Um let's say

363
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:57,839
I can hold gold that gives me no

364
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:00,399
interest rate. I can hold Swiss Franks

365
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:04,480
which don't give me much interest rate.

366
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:06,480
I can hold US dollars what which will

367
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,880
give me depending on the maturity but

368
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,720
let's say will give me a 4% interest

369
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,839
rate. My basic question is if gold goes

370
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,959
up by more than 4%. Go gold has to go up

371
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:22,560
by more than 4% then I'm better holding

372
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:25,519
gold and if it goes up by less than 4%.

373
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,000
Then I'm better holding the bond uh that

374
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,160
that will operate. So I keep thinking

375
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,480
about though you know that question and

376
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,120
the world keeps thinking about that

377
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,839
question.

378
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,720
>> Mhm. When I think of store of value, I

379
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,639
also think of

380
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,680
gold, money, US dollar, whatever

381
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,600
currency be it. If I own equity in

382
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,639
something very basic like a farm for

383
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,360
example, which is producing a certain

384
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,720
good, that makes it more funible almost,

385
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,320
right?

386
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,920
>> All assets

387
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,440
>> are valued as their appreciation in

388
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,600
price

389
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,440
and their yield. the yield that you're

390
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,319
getting

391
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,199
and the price change and that's a total

392
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,919
return. And so all assets you compare on

393
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,880
that basis. If you're holding a farm,

394
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,439
>> same deal. Okay. Uh in other words, what

395
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,919
is the yield on that farm from holding

396
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,439
it?

397
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,079
>> Generally more than 4%.

398
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,400
>> No, I'm not getting into the specifics.

399
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,959
I'm getting into the mechanics. So when

400
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,360
looking at the markets as a whole, what

401
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,400
I do is I just compare everything.

402
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:36,960
Right. Okay? Because all I want to do is

403
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:40,080
I want to essentially borrow or be short

404
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,000
>> those that will have the lower returns

405
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,240
relative to those that will have the

406
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,200
higher returns. So it's constantly

407
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,480
calculations in that way however you get

408
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,360
there. And that's true of your farm as

409
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,480
it is on the other. But I think that the

410
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,600
farm or illquid assets should have to

411
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,559
give me a higher return because I'm not

412
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,520
going to have the choice of easily

413
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,919
selling that farm and buying that farm.

414
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,120
Whereas that choice that flexibility

415
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,720
that liquidity

416
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,640
>> but I'm talking about the public equity

417
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,720
of a farm farming company.

418
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,240
>> Okay. Then you are dealing with the

419
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,720
public liquidity. I didn't know that.

420
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,280
But yeah in terms of that. So then

421
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,240
there's no liquidity premium. Still that

422
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,960
same calculation. Okay. What is the

423
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,039
yield and then what is the price change

424
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,600
relative? What is that? That'll be my

425
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,160
return. And what is that relative to the

426
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,160
other things I could be in? And

427
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,360
basically you start to think when you

428
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,160
think of leverage. You start to think uh

429
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,960
okay it doesn't have to be about zero.

430
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:49,200
Zero means like no leverage. when you

431
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:52,559
start to think okay I can be if if the

432
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:56,240
lesser returning asset

433
00:18:52,559 --> 00:19:01,360
can become a liability meaning I can

434
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:04,640
then borrow it and get higher here then

435
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,200
I want to get that spread and that's how

436
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,039
I think of the issue of using leverage

437
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,880
and then the issue is how do you deal

438
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:14,960
with the risk but the ri the risk is not

439
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,039
something that is that like zero

440
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,919
leverage and it's a black and white

441
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,600
thing. It's a continuous thing. Look, I

442
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,400
should say the following. There are two

443
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:28,240
important ways to invent to invest.

444
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,640
Okay. The first is

445
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,120
what if you can't beat the market?

446
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,200
>> Mhm.

447
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,520
>> Most people can't beat the market.

448
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,880
>> So when they start off, everything isn't

449
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:42,880
a bet. It's like if I don't know what to

450
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:46,000
bet on, what is my portfolio? And so you

451
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,919
should start with what is that mix of

452
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,400
assets if you're not a trader and so on.

453
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,799
um what is the right mix and that's for

454
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,720
example why a lot of Indians hold gold

455
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,480
or a lot of people hold gold they don't

456
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,840
want to bet but they just saying that'll

457
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,840
be a sold of wealth

458
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,720
>> once you have that portfolio that

459
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,520
portfolio should be a well diversified

460
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,559
portfolio that assumes you can't market

461
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,880
time

462
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,120
>> then there's the question can you market

463
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,440
time okay

464
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,760
>> so you're asking me a market timing

465
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,760
question I want to distinguish it I

466
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,679
don't think most people should play a

467
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,400
market timing question. And when you're

468
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,679
asking me my t market timing, I view

469
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,919
that question with a lot of

470
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,039
responsibility because maybe I'm right

471
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,559
and maybe I'm wrong. I wanted to preface

472
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,559
answering your question with that

473
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,159
explanation and then I'll go back to

474
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:41,120
answering your question. I money is debt

475
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:43,840
and debt is money. What I mean money So

476
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,080
here's mechanics. You're holding a debt

477
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,880
instrument. What you're holding is a

478
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,120
promise to deliver some money. Mhm.

479
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,679
>> And what that money is worth will

480
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,240
determine what the value of what you're

481
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,080
holding is. Okay. You're really you're

482
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,840
holding when they hold that debt, you're

483
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,799
holding money that if it's devalued,

484
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,000
you're going to be sorry. Okay? And

485
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:08,000
money is debt. And what I mean by that,

486
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,240
when you're holding your money, you're

487
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,799
holding it in a debt instrument. So

488
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,320
money is debt and debt is money. And so

489
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,559
now I'm when I'm answering your

490
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,280
question, to me there's too much debt

491
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,200
and we're producing it too much. And so

492
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,039
when I'm looking at that and I'm looking

493
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,360
at around the world and I'm not just

494
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:28,080
looking at it in the United States, I'm

495
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,880
looking at it in the UK and in France

496
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,120
and in China and in most countries.

497
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,280
We're producing too much debt. That

498
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,280
means I don't want that kind of money.

499
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,159
So when because I don't want that kind

500
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,640
of money, I look at well that's why I

501
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,760
prefer and have been preferring the

502
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,280
holding of gold to that kind of money. I

503
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,679
think when you think about your

504
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,440
portfolio, you should start to think

505
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,600
again if you don't have how any um what

506
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,120
should you be holding? I think

507
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:02,320
individuals or if you look at the

508
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,559
quality of money and like gold let's

509
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,720
call it you want to stay I would say I

510
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,200
want to stay out of fiat currencies and

511
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,600
I want to stay out of those things on a

512
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,039
tactical bet not on the strategic asset

513
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:18,400
allocation bet when I do that um I'm I

514
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:21,520
think to myself um okay what should I

515
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,640
have and an individual and most

516
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:29,520
investors should have between five and

517
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:32,400
15% of their portfolio in a a gold or an

518
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,000
alternative money. Now, it depends what

519
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,360
other assets they have in the portfolio.

520
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,360
>> Even if they're starting today to build

521
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,880
a portfolio after the gold appreciation

522
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,320
of the last year, I

523
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,960
>> I think that they they have to stop even

524
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,520
thinking about the appreciation and

525
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,600
market timing as a starting point. You

526
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,720
have to say what amount am I going to

527
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,200
hold?

528
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,200
>> Okay, what is that right amount? and

529
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,919
it'll be beat. So the answer to the

530
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,840
question is yes, forget about and we can

531
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,919
get into the pricing of gold or what it

532
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,799
might do and what it might not do. But

533
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,679
still you okay I need to hold that

534
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,440
amount because that amount is the right

535
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,080
amount. If you were to go through a

536
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,960
portfolio optimization and you were to

537
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,360
say what um through a mechanical

538
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,600
portfolio optimization and you say what

539
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,840
is my mix of assets to create the right

540
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,039
portfolio. If you're holding stocks and

541
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,760
you're holding other assets because gold

542
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:31,200
gold is over a period of time a

543
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,760
lowturning asset class like cash. It'll

544
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:38,559
produce it has produced and for logical

545
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:40,960
reasons it produces about a 1.2% a year

546
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:44,559
real return. That's that's that's a low

547
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,640
real return, but it is highly um

548
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,280
diversifying because when the other

549
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,840
parts of the portfolio do very badly,

550
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,679
let's say be because of certain things

551
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,000
like we're talking about stagflation,

552
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,400
you print money and all debt issues,

553
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,520
then the gold does very well. So, it

554
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,080
also has a diversification benefit in

555
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,880
terms of the portfolio. For those

556
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,919
reasons, it is the most fundamental

557
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,600
money that we know of and it is at the

558
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:16,799
same time an effective diversifier to

559
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:21,279
other things. That'll get you to that 50

560
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:23,440
between five and 15% of the portfolio.

561
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,080
>> While we're speaking about currency, how

562
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,120
do you view crypto and the world of

563
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,520
Bitcoin?

564
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:34,000
>> Um, Bitcoin is limited in supply and its

565
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,720
perception of money. It is a form of

566
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,240
money. It it's perceived as money as a

567
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,919
storehold of wealth that is unlikely to

568
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:48,240
be significantly held by central banks

569
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:51,600
and many others because of a number of

570
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,000
problems it has. It can't transactions

571
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,480
could all be followed in Bitcoin. One

572
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,080
can monitor what the transactions are.

573
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,640
governments can monitor what the

574
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,440
transactions are and governments can

575
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,279
interfere with those transactions just

576
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,440
like we talked about earlier when we

577
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:10,559
talked about you know gold is the only

578
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,880
asset that you can have that they can't

579
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,600
uh mess with and control you've got it

580
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,760
okay that's not true of Bitcoin and then

581
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,559
there are other issues in Bitcoin like

582
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,200
if we talked about the possibility would

583
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,840
somebody make uh synthetic gold like

584
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,840
they would make um uh synthetic diamond

585
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:33,120
diamonds um as as a risk. Well, in terms

586
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,840
of Bitcoin being cracked, broken, all

587
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,159
sorts of things and controlled, it has

588
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,679
those issues. Okay. So, that's how I

589
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,960
look at Bitcoin. You're not bullish.

590
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,799
>> I have a little No, no. I'm I'm bearish

591
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,159
on fiat currencies

592
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,559
>> and bearish on uh

593
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,120
>> So, when I look at the world, I'm I'm

594
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,000
just trying to say then I say, what do I

595
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,840
hold?

596
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,320
>> Okay. So, I hold a little bit of

597
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,240
Bitcoin. I have a little bit of Bitcoin,

598
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,640
but for me, it's not as attractive as um

599
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,400
uh gold for the reasons you asked me my

600
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,520
thoughts. Those are my thoughts about

601
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,120
Bitcoin.

602
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,600
>> A stable coin um is attached to the fiat

603
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,919
currency. So, it goes down like the fiat

604
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,320
currency goes down and it doesn't give

605
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,840
an interest rate and and they're toying

606
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,360
around with what whether it gives

607
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,960
interest rates or not, but there's not a

608
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,840
model that I've seen. So, so far um it's

609
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,080
used largely for immediate quick

610
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,960
transactions and not a storehold of

611
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,200
wealth but immediate quick transactions

612
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,440
and it may be an efficient way to have

613
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,760
that but it's not my storehold of wealth

614
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,679
yet I don't see the merit of it. So if I

615
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,279
were to build your portfolio array of

616
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,760
storehold of wealth, just that

617
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,799
component, let's say 5 to 15 goes to

618
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,240
gold. How much goes to uh you said you

619
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,520
have a little bitcoin. What percentage

620
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,840
would that be?

621
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,679
>> I'm not going to give you what I've got,

622
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:58,159
but I'll give you just general

623
00:26:53,679 --> 00:27:02,000
guidelines. Um it depends on

624
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:05,840
um the type of equities.

625
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,679
You you can't talk about equities as

626
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,279
equities. Mhm.

627
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,400
>> Because they're too divergent.

628
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,880
>> Mhm.

629
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,840
>> As we're seeing for example now, it's so

630
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,799
contrary uh the magnificence of it and

631
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,880
and AI and tech is such a dominant

632
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,279
thing. So in order to think about

633
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,480
portfolio construction,

634
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:28,480
you have to think what type of equities,

635
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,000
where do you hold those equities?

636
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,559
>> I'm not talking about equity. I'm

637
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,440
talking about the assets that you hold

638
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:38,799
with relatively lower risk like gold and

639
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,799
treasury and bitcoin which is not you

640
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,120
taking a bet on a particular industry

641
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,600
but someplace to park money. What else

642
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,320
would you

643
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,240
>> I see. In other words, you're you're not

644
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,279
asking whether there's equities in the

645
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,200
portfolio or bonds or what country or

646
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:56,159
anything like that. You're just saying

647
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,080
that piece of equities. Okay. Then you

648
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,720
think about

649
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,960
um that on that storehold of wealth, you

650
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,480
start to think about what that nature of

651
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,919
that thing is. There aren't many. Some

652
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,399
might say there are gems. Some might say

653
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,799
there are works of art. I mean basically

654
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:18,000
when they say these things they're going

655
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:19,919
through criteria which is uh can I move

656
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,159
them around?

657
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,880
>> Um are they storeholds of wealth that

658
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,360
are recognized in different places?

659
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,919
They're not like real estate. Real

660
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,679
estate is something that's nailed down

661
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:36,399
in a location. It's easy to tax. It's

662
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:39,440
not transferable and so on. So, it's

663
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,360
the, you know, th those kinds of things,

664
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,600
>> right? Do you think real estate should

665
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,240
be taxed? Like we have very low property

666
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,399
taxes.

667
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,720
>> I think I think what should be taxed?

668
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:54,480
I mean like if I was to create up

669
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:57,279
priority list, first tax this, last tax

670
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,080
this and so on. And I would say in real

671
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:03,600
estate, um I think there's the question

672
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,679
of what does it mean for the economy or

673
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,080
what does it mean for those who are

674
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,480
being taxed or what does it mean for

675
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,120
those who are taxing? I think the

676
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,000
practical aspect of real estate in terms

677
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,159
of taxing is because the individual

678
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,720
owner of real estate can't take it with

679
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:24,960
them. It is a very practical asset asset

680
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,760
to tax for the government

681
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,399
>> because they they can always

682
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,600
>> tax that and you can't take it with you

683
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:36,159
versus the other. So I think uh while uh

684
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,880
you know what should be taxed is a

685
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,679
dependent on who you're asking should

686
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:45,279
it's a for the government it's a very

687
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:48,159
effective thing to tax for an individual

688
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:51,039
um it's another in terms of its economic

689
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,679
um impact I think it's fine to tax real

690
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,240
estate there's nothing you got to tax

691
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:59,440
something I I think now do you want to

692
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,360
have such a tax burd burden on any one

693
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,080
thing that it's crushing to to the

694
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,840
economy. Then just generally taxes I

695
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,000
would say you know I want to spread them

696
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,600
out and then I would tax things that are

697
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,480
harmful you know like um what I I don't

698
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,600
know if they call them sin taxes. Okay.

699
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,240
If I don't know maybe cigarettes or you

700
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,919
know um I don't know those things or and

701
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,159
then some things that are harmful and

702
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,320
you the least things you would tax are

703
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,440
those things that are helpful.

704
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:34,240
>> Yeah. I make a case for taxing real

705
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:36,799
estate because I think a lot of the

706
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,720
benefits of corruption and the bad

707
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,320
money, the black money in a way sits in

708
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,399
real estate and that might be a good way

709
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,360
to bring it into the tax system.

710
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,000
>> Okay.

711
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:49,039
>> Personally, if you go back to your life,

712
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,200
you spoke about going to college after

713
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,919
you began trading, after you were a

714
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,679
caddy and after.

715
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,440
Do you think there are roles today like

716
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,840
the role of a caddy where you work

717
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,279
around influential people and you can

718
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,320
learn by virtue of being in their

719
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,240
proximity?

720
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,360
>> It's always it's always of course great

721
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,919
to be about around smart people if they

722
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,480
don't want to be an entrepreneur

723
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,480
whatever it is uh be around a smart

724
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,360
entrepreneur and talk. Yeah, that's

725
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,679
great. Sure.

726
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,960
>> What was caddy the job of a caddy back

727
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,760
then? What do you think it would be

728
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,360
today?

729
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,080
>> Well, they do the same. And they can't

730
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,360
they carry bags or they put them on golf

731
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,440
carts and but they walk there and it if

732
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,520
you're walking with people who are it's

733
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,360
an entrepreneur or if you were a

734
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,799
physicist and you're walking with want

735
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,760
to be a physicist and you're talking

736
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,760
with a physicist

737
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,000
>> any suggestion of other jobs like the

738
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,279
caddy job today cuz

739
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,600
>> whatever gets what whatever gets you two

740
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:48,320
things I'd suggest

741
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,760
>> first play the game if you have an

742
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,760
opportunity to play the game you can

743
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,720
play the Well, the one of the beauties

744
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,559
of the markets is it doesn't take a big

745
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,200
portfolio to play the game. I I had $50.

746
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:03,519
I went into the game and I and because

747
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,320
the market pieces can be broken up into

748
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:09,120
small sizes. You can almost play the

749
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,519
game the same as a huge investor can

750
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,399
play the game. Ease of access, you've

751
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:17,440
got that in terms of those. So, the game

752
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:20,399
that you get into at an early age will

753
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,120
influence you a lot. If I look at um

754
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,960
like age 12, I'll give you that example.

755
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,919
There's some people who say the

756
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,720
psychologists will say prior to 12

757
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:33,600
people learn differently um because

758
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,200
puberty at the age of puberty prior to

759
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,200
that you learn if you're learning a

760
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,200
language or learning a sport or learning

761
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,200
things. Anyway, the earlier you start

762
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,840
learning the better it is, the more

763
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,480
internal learning that you have. And so

764
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:50,000
play play the game, whatever it is. Bill

765
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,880
Gates um and a lot of uh the you know

766
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,480
key tech people like to play gaming.

767
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,200
They were in gaming and they would hack

768
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,679
the games and they would play in the

769
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,960
computer and that'll affect them. So

770
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,360
play the game, find a game that you love

771
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,120
and ideally one that makes money. Wow.

772
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,840
If you can do those two things together,

773
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,880
that's a terrific thing. Play the game

774
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,799
and then be around people who are pros

775
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,440
at playing the game so you can chat

776
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,519
about it. That's a good path.

777
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,159
>> Leverage in speculation, especially

778
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,159
around equity markets.

779
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,360
Across the world, many people seem to be

780
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,360
coming down on qualify a investor more

781
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,720
before you allow him to speculate, buy

782
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,080
futures or options. U

783
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,720
do you think that should happen or

784
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:40,240
should a young kid who's 18 and has that

785
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,480
$50 be allowed to speculate?

786
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,720
These are questions about I mean they're

787
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:49,919
they're broader questions about um

788
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:53,279
being taken advantage financially versus

789
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,679
learning experiences. I I don't mind any

790
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:58,080
kind of risk something that becomes a

791
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,039
tolerable amount of risk. That's

792
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:05,039
different from exploitation. Okay. And

793
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:07,360
so, um, I think that it's incumbent, it

794
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,639
should be incumbent on anybody who's

795
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,200
selling any investment product to be,

796
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,159
uh, dealing with it at a certain age to

797
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,800
be thinking about am I exploiting that

798
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,800
person or not. Okay. So, that's but

799
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,280
that's a balance for regulators to deal

800
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,399
with,

801
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,960
>> right?

802
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,119
>> Uh, do you have a view on uh, prediction

803
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,320
markets? Like I know Shane Shane

804
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,560
>> I like them. I like them.

805
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:28,879
>> Yeah.

806
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,320
>> Yeah.

807
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,240
>> Shane and Taric are friends of mine. and

808
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:37,440
they both live in New York. Kalshi and

809
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:39,520
uh poly market u in the future does a

810
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,240
lot of what is happening on stock

811
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,119
markets move there cuz you can speculate

812
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:48,720
on just about anything

813
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,440
>> mostly different act events to bet on

814
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,320
and I think events affect companies but

815
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,440
they're two different things so I would

816
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,960
say um it'll be something to speculate

817
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:04,480
on um but and It' be something that

818
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,720
smart people may use as a hedging device

819
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,359
against owning an equity. Like if this

820
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,920
event happens, that event that you can

821
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:14,880
speculate on, and that might have an

822
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,800
adverse effect to the stock I'm holding,

823
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,800
there'll be all sorts of engineering and

824
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,920
so on. I would imagine you'd see

825
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,200
something like that happening. Um, but

826
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,800
uh, we'll see, you know.

827
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,200
>> So, you would use it like a leading

828
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,280
indicator to make stock decisions.

829
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,599
>> I not a leading indicator. I wouldn't

830
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,079
view it as a leading indicator. I mean,

831
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:37,760
you might think about it. It gives you

832
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,680
information, but um uh it's a vehicle to

833
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,800
speculate. It's a vehicle to use to

834
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,680
hedge. Um it gives you some notion of

835
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,400
what those who are, uh speculating on

836
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,400
it, um is there are certain things that

837
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,640
I'd like to try to get across here in

838
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,839
our interview that I'd like to, you

839
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,680
know, what what is the difference

840
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,760
between wealth and money? Mhm.

841
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,920
>> There's certain things that if I can get

842
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,560
across to your audience, I'd like to get

843
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,000
across.

844
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,480
>> Yeah. Do you want to go wealth and money

845
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,880
first?

846
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,599
>> Okay.

847
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,760
>> Yeah.

848
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,760
>> Bubbles and wealth and money.

849
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,079
>> People are not used to dealing with the

850
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:20,000
difference in them and it's very

851
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:21,119
important. Wealth can easily be created

852
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,800
the way we [clears throat] account for

853
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,640
wealth. For example, if you're you start

854
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,160
a company

855
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,720
and

856
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,440
let's say you want to make a unicorn,

857
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,320
you sell $50 million worth of it. You

858
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,200
value it at a billion dollar. You're now

859
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:42,320
a billionaire and it counts in wealth as

860
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:45,440
a billion dollars and there's but nobody

861
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:48,480
would pay a billion dollars for that

862
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,720
issue combined. Okay? And that's a lot

863
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,160
of what's happening now with wealth and

864
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,720
and and if you look at the 1920s bubbles

865
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,000
or you look at those what you see in one

866
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:03,520
way or another is that wealth goes up

867
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
and people feel wealthy but the wealth

868
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,119
isn't worth anything if you don't sell

869
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,240
it convert it into money to spend.

870
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,160
Right? So people should know that okay

871
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,240
that when they have this wealth they

872
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,440
perceive they have the wealth and so on

873
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,920
you it's not worth anything unless you

874
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,800
can uh convert it into money and spend

875
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,880
it other than it's utilitarian value but

876
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,800
it's not worth what it what it is and

877
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,400
that's how bubbles are created the

878
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,640
mechanics of how that bubbles are

879
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,920
created in one way or another that

880
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,640
happens okay then there comes along the

881
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,119
need for money so what happened and how

882
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,359
does that work for one reason or

883
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,160
another. Somebody's got to get that

884
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:49,119
money that money who and they have

885
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,960
wealth. So they sell wealth in order to

886
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,440
get money and then the bubble comes

887
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,280
down. So if you look at the 20s and

888
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,079
there or you look at any of the bubbles,

889
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:01,920
the Japanese bubble or you look at the

890
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:05,119
2000 bubble and so on, you can see this

891
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,079
dynamic because it can be created

892
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,079
without money. Money is the means that

893
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,560
settles transactions. It's very

894
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:16,320
different from credit. Okay? When you

895
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:19,040
get credit to buy something, um you have

896
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,440
an obligation to deliver money. But when

897
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,680
you get money and you buy something, you

898
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,359
have no obligation to deliver anything.

899
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,160
You've paid for it. You've settled your

900
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:32,240
transaction. So now when I when we look

901
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:35,839
at this, we have right now a very high

902
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:38,800
ratio of wealth to money. And this is

903
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:42,000
particularly important now. Okay. And

904
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,960
there's a and we have a very large also

905
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,240
wealth gaps and values gaps. But when

906
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,880
you have such a large wealth gap and and

907
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,359
you have populism of the left and the

908
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,640
right and so on and you have the notion

909
00:38:53,359 --> 00:39:00,400
of wealth taxes, you can have wealth tax

910
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,400
as wealth taxes come in. What? And and

911
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,760
the wealth is so large relative to the

912
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:09,040
money. um if you're not taxing wealth uh

913
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,040
wealth then people can get very wealthy

914
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,520
and no money can be raised for for the

915
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,480
taxes. So there's a real pressure to tax

916
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:20,240
wealth and if you tax wealth then people

917
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,720
have to sell in order to get the money

918
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,760
to pay the taxes and that creates a

919
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,480
dynamic that can pop a bubble. So in my

920
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,440
opinion, we're in a bubble, okay, by

921
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,480
various measures of it being in a bubble

922
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:37,119
and uh and people feeling very wealthy,

923
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,720
but you have that vulnerability. So that

924
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:43,359
is largely the dynamic of when we see

925
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,400
these wealth booms and then the wealth

926
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:48,000
bumps. I wanted to convey that. Okay. So

927
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,839
that's the first thing I want to convey.

928
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,880
>> Is there a way to calculate wealth to

929
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,359
money ratio which you

930
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,599
>> Yes, I do. I do. Right. wealth to money

931
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:59,839
ratio right now in the United States is

932
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:02,480
about 8 12:1 and and so on and when you

933
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:06,400
look at it um and then also then there's

934
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:09,200
what it's in the stock market um is is

935
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,200
right now about 3 to one and uh and

936
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:15,839
that's very high if you were to go back

937
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:18,640
to 1929 or 2000 it's at about the same

938
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,520
level uh as it was in those times

939
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,160
>> is it higher today than 2008 and 2000

940
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,000
>> well 2000 2000 was the peak.

941
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,760
>> Mhm. How much was it?

942
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,920
>> Uh same same as today. The same same uh

943
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,960
same levels. If you take 1929, 2000 and

944
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,200
now it's all right now. If you look at

945
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:44,400
that chart, you can you can see that

946
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:48,000
chart. So, um we have a lot of wealth

947
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:51,040
and a lot of equity wealth relative to

948
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,079
money. Do you think it could be possible

949
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,560
that tomorrow wealth tax is collected in

950
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:59,680
equity and not money?

951
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,599
>> No. Because they have to spend it and

952
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,920
they have to pay it. In other words, the

953
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,720
liability that it's going to fund can't

954
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,359
be paid by I'm going to give you a piece

955
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,560
of my farmland. You know, you get a

956
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,680
piece of the farmland.

957
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,079
>> The government gets a piece of the

958
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,839
farmland.

959
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,440
>> Yeah, that's what you're suggesting. I

960
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,640
don't think that's realistic. You get a

961
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,520
piece of the farmland,

962
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,760
>> right? [laughter]

963
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,040
>> Okay. You're not going to feed people in

964
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,079
inner cities with a piece of the

965
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,000
farmland,

966
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,760
>> right? If that were to happen, people

967
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,839
will have lesser incentive to work on

968
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,720
the farm cuz eventually the government

969
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:32,400
will own too much.

970
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,720
>> I don't think so. Um, so I want to talk

971
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,720
about the five big forces that that

972
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:41,599
drive things. Yeah. If I can. Um, first

973
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:45,599
there is a debt, money, economy, markets

974
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:48,880
dynamic. Credit creates buying but it

975
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:51,680
creates debt. And when it creates debt,

976
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,079
there's an obligation to pay back. And

977
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,800
then the and and so how that dynamic

978
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:59,520
works. The second big force happens

979
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,400
simultaneously is the internal political

980
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,880
force. You experience it India, every

981
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,960
country does, we experience here.

982
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,440
There's an element here of that

983
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,440
political force that there is left and

984
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,960
right. In other words, the rich and the

985
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,680
poor and the conflict and how to run a

986
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,720
country and so on. So that political

987
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,200
force and there's a cycle uh just as

988
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,599
there's a debt cycle that means that you

989
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,560
cannot increase your debt past a certain

990
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,599
point and that changes that monetary

991
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:34,880
order cycle lasts something like a

992
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:37,280
lifetime. Um and that that's the debt

993
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,760
cycle. There is a political cycle that

994
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,599
goes with that that has the left and the

995
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,960
right and the political and we are in

996
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:47,280
the middle of that. So the nature of our

997
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,520
governance system and the nature of

998
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:55,280
democracy, the risk of do you we're past

999
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:58,800
the point of um saying that we'll abide

1000
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:01,440
by the rules. Okay, it's a it that when

1001
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:05,200
you have populism of both sides, it's a

1002
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:08,240
win at all cost type of approach. Will

1003
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,880
you accept election results? Can you can

1004
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:13,440
the government compromise? Can it govern

1005
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,800
in that way? That political cycle is

1006
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,720
number two and it matters a lot that all

1007
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,160
these cycles relate to each other.

1008
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,720
Number three is the geopolitical order,

1009
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:28,160
the world order. In other words, we came

1010
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:30,720
out of 1945. You come out of the you end

1011
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,319
a war and then the dominant powers

1012
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:36,560
determine how the world order works, how

1013
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:38,720
who has what power, what the rules are.

1014
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,040
that was dominated by the United States

1015
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,680
because of the power it had and then you

1016
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:47,040
have changes in relative power the

1017
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,520
emergence of China the um relative

1018
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,079
decline of the United States India's

1019
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,240
role and other places role that world

1020
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,640
order has changed that world order has

1021
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,520
gone from a world order that it was a

1022
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,079
multilateral world order sort of with

1023
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,960
rules like the United Nations and the

1024
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:07,200
world trade organization and the world

1025
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,200
uh health organization and the world

1026
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,359
this is you know the world bank and the

1027
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,160
world this and the world that in terms

1028
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:17,040
of multilateral governance and that is

1029
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,280
over. Okay. So we no longer have that

1030
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:23,520
kind of a world order. We have a world

1031
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,839
order which is dominated by uh power

1032
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:29,359
power struggles and as we deal with

1033
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:32,160
that. So those three cycles, that money

1034
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:34,880
cycle, that debt money cycle, that

1035
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,359
internal order and disorder cycle, that

1036
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,839
international world order cycle, they

1037
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,359
tend to coincide. And throughout

1038
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:43,440
history, when you have that that

1039
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,920
convergence, you almost have a perfect

1040
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,040
storm of that. The fourth influence

1041
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,200
through time has been climate um acts of

1042
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,599
nature. Droughts, floods, and pandemics

1043
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,000
have killed more people than wars and

1044
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,920
changed more orders. And number five

1045
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,319
always through history is man's

1046
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,280
inventiveness particularly of new

1047
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:05,920
technologies. So everything that we're

1048
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,640
we would ever talk about in the markets

1049
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,800
in the economy will fall under those

1050
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,200
things practically everything. And it's

1051
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,839
the inter relationship of those things

1052
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:18,079
and the arc through history that one

1053
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:21,520
needs to see in order to understand

1054
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:23,359
what's going on. So my basic view is

1055
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,359
that there are many things that happen

1056
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:28,960
over and over through history that

1057
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:31,920
haven't happened in our lifetimes that

1058
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,760
are very educational, very valuable in

1059
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,359
being making decisions.

1060
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,839
>> I'm going to ask you a question Ray. How

1061
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:40,560
does a youngster, this is a very candid,

1062
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:43,359
pragmatic question. How does a youngster

1063
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,200
in India who's 25 years old say his name

1064
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,800
is Nikil and he's living in India in

1065
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:51,280
Bombay

1066
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:53,599
u how does he make money using all this

1067
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,599
information and framework cuz that's his

1068
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,359
objective

1069
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,280
play the game

1070
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:02,480
>> how do I use this information to play

1071
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,240
the game better I I think I think

1072
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:08,079
there's cerebral learning and there's

1073
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:10,960
visceral learning you know and um so I

1074
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,200
can tell we could talk like this, but we

1075
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,520
are it's a different thing. Once you

1076
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,520
start to get into playing the game,

1077
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:21,520
whatever the game is, little

1078
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:23,760
entrepreneur on um street corner selling

1079
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,880
something. Okay, that's you play the

1080
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,960
money game.

1081
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,119
>> Okay, whatever way you play the money

1082
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,280
game. Maybe it's in the public markets,

1083
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,119
maybe it's in you buy a little piece of

1084
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,960
real estate or you have a hot dog stand.

1085
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,280
I don't know what it is, but you play

1086
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,720
the game. And as you start to play the

1087
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,960
game, you'll start to learn the

1088
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,359
fundamentals of the game. You, and we

1089
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,599
talked about this, be around people who

1090
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:47,119
also play the game. So while you're

1091
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,839
playing it, and you will learn through

1092
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:52,720
your experiences and your reflections

1093
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:54,880
and the help of other people.

1094
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,200
I think everybody wants to play the game

1095
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,960
and they're attempting to play the game.

1096
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,960
But what would be really cool is if we

1097
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,880
can get an insight from you of how to

1098
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,599
play the game. Like if I were to be

1099
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,839
looking to begin today, should I look at

1100
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,960
is value in public markets, in private

1101
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:12,400
markets? Should I be

1102
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:15,359
>> I I I I think it's more like the

1103
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,599
opposite. What happens is

1104
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,839
you find your thing.

1105
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,520
>> Okay. There are many different games.

1106
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:24,400
Look, if you look around you, there are

1107
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:29,040
many different games. You know, it's um

1108
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:32,560
I have my grandchildren um sell um hot

1109
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:35,040
cider in the winter in a park and then

1110
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:38,400
what and then they understand capital

1111
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:41,200
formation. I have to buy the f the the

1112
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,280
flask. I have to buy the table. Okay,

1113
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,240
that's capital formation. Then they

1114
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:49,119
understand when they go out that okay if

1115
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:52,560
I can uh produce it what's my

1116
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:55,599
incremental cost unit cost for producing

1117
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:57,920
it relative to I I could sell it at this

1118
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,640
I have a margin of this then they

1119
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,240
understand margin and then they

1120
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:06,160
understand that they make money when

1121
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:08,240
that overcomes their capital cost okay

1122
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,319
the playing the game they start to think

1123
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,040
about that way then they start speaking

1124
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:16,960
with others gee can I where can I get

1125
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:19,839
the cider cheaper or whatever and and so

1126
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:22,319
on. So there are all these games around

1127
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:23,920
you, okay? And start to play. Then

1128
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:27,359
you'll ask the questions, then you'll

1129
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:30,000
dig and so on. Uh or yeah, you can find

1130
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:32,000
somebody or help you. They might say,

1131
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,960
"Hey, here's this little job that you

1132
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:39,040
can do." Whatever it is, it is that

1133
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:42,400
little germination that then creates

1134
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:44,800
um mo empires that that that's the

1135
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:48,079
process of going from wherever you are

1136
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,079
in India to or wherever you are for me

1137
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,559
catting on a golf course in the United

1138
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:55,119
States that's the process that allows

1139
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:58,079
that to grow and develop over a period

1140
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:01,839
of time. It's very helpful to understand

1141
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:05,680
your nature. Okay, people have different

1142
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:07,839
pulls. Some people are more riskaverse.

1143
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:11,040
Some people like to pay attention to the

1144
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:13,920
big picture. Others

1145
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:16,960
will handle risk. Others will pay

1146
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,319
attention to the details. What is your

1147
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:24,000
nature? So I created online, it's free

1148
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:26,160
online a test called principles you. I

1149
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,079
recommend you take it. everybody take it

1150
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,240
and they'll look at you and through

1151
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,800
answering questions you'll learn about

1152
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,000
yourself and if you also have other

1153
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,079
people that you know you have

1154
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,559
relationships you'll look at them to

1155
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,280
help to identify their nature what is

1156
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:44,079
their inclinations and I think that what

1157
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,640
what really is the journey in life is to

1158
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:50,079
try to know about your nature and find

1159
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:52,720
it connection to the right path right so

1160
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:55,359
there are many right paths for all your

1161
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,359
audience I want you to know your nature

1162
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:59,599
and try to match it up with what the

1163
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:03,200
right path is for you.

1164
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:05,839
>> Um, for the trader in me, uh, if I were

1165
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,359
to go back in time and be 18 years old

1166
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:11,280
again,

1167
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:13,680
if I were to specifically ask you,

1168
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,839
you you model people a lot in the sense

1169
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,200
that you psychoanalyze them. You let you

1170
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:20,079
have them go through different kind of

1171
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,880
testing to figure out what psychology is

1172
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:25,280
suited to what. What works for a trader,

1173
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,520
Ray? What makes a trader successful?

1174
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:31,040
>> There are many way when when you use the

1175
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:33,839
word trader, it has an implication of a

1176
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:36,720
certain way of operating that may that

1177
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:39,920
is only a small percentage of the total

1178
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:44,559
way of investing. Right? So, uh it's the

1179
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:46,640
person who um the it could be buys this

1180
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:49,280
from here and sells it from here. It

1181
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,200
could be the form of you know you buy a

1182
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,200
bracelet here and you sell a bracelet

1183
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,920
here and you do it or it could be a

1184
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:58,480
stock trader and so on so forth and that

1185
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,640
implies like buy sell and so on. There

1186
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,559
are many other ways. I think you have to

1187
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,559
if you're understanding let's say

1188
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:07,040
investing then you have to understand

1189
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:09,440
the various ways of converting one thing

1190
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,280
to another thing and making a profit and

1191
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,160
that's why I give the example of the

1192
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:18,400
cider case and and so on uh for being

1193
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:21,760
able to do that. Uh a trader I say think

1194
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,599
biases it too much to the guy who's

1195
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,640
flipping. But I think for this example,

1196
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:29,200
let's say what is the archetype of a

1197
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,359
trader, bar, investor that would help

1198
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,680
him succeed psychologic.

1199
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:35,599
>> First,

1200
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,440
you're going to go into it and you're

1201
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:40,480
going to get hooked on it like getting

1202
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,960
hooked on a game. Okay? And you're not

1203
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,599
going to know anything. And then through

1204
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:49,760
those experiences, what you need to do

1205
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:52,160
is be curious to understand mechanics.

1206
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,720
Okay? What are the cause effect

1207
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,839
relationships? What are the things that

1208
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:00,079
make the market go up or down so that

1209
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:02,400
you can in whatever it is whether you're

1210
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:04,160
a day trader or whether you're investor

1211
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,400
you have to get into the mechanics and

1212
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:09,200
you have to learn the mechanics right

1213
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,680
and through that experience and you if

1214
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:14,400
you think and you're curious and you

1215
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:17,839
could research then you can do that. I

1216
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,760
am creating a platform that anybody can

1217
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:22,319
use to help them do that. In other

1218
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,680
words, there's information and the way

1219
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:28,240
you make decisions is your brain brings

1220
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:32,400
in information and it puts it through

1221
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:34,000
criteria that determine action. Okay,

1222
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:37,680
that's how the brain works. That's all

1223
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,720
the decisions. And so you have to learn

1224
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:43,760
what are uh what is the criteria that

1225
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:46,880
are and the criteria is cause effect

1226
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:49,680
relationships because causes happen

1227
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:52,160
before effects. And if you understand

1228
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:54,400
cause effect relationships and you

1229
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,240
understand the causes, you can bet on

1230
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,559
the effects that it will be have

1231
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:02,079
happening from that. So you have to be

1232
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:03,760
curious and you have to be analytical to

1233
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,760
understand those cause effect

1234
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,720
relationships. You begin a journey.

1235
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,640
Okay? Because if you're just gambling

1236
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,800
and you don't understand the cause, you

1237
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,680
won't have an edge. You need to have an

1238
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,520
edge. Okay? And that is by knowing those

1239
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,319
cause effect relationships and playing

1240
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:22,400
your bet and how to organize your bets

1241
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:24,319
so that there's a diversified group of

1242
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,800
bets because the power of

1243
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:30,160
diversification means that you can

1244
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,960
greatly reduce risk without reducing

1245
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,800
returns.

1246
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,720
>> Right? What else do we have? Curiosity

1247
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,400
understanding cause effect relationship

1248
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,480
then

1249
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,720
>> on uh being addicted to the game and

1250
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,280
getting the best guidance you can get.

1251
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,680
>> Right? How does one get guidance?

1252
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,520
Oh, guidance is all around you. I'm part

1253
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,559
of the guidance here today. There are

1254
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,720
courses you can take. Okay. Once you

1255
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:54,720
have the curiosity,

1256
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,400
>> then you will dig and you will learn and

1257
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,200
you will experiment.

1258
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:02,400
>> Is that what worked for you? You still

1259
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:05,280
>> you still come across as a very curious

1260
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,680
person. It almost feels like you're

1261
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,559
trying to answer the question of life.

1262
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,119
>> Yeah.

1263
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:12,480
>> That can't be answered in a way. I I'm

1264
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,040
learning more every day,

1265
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,240
>> right?

1266
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:19,680
>> And I can't answer it all understand it

1267
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:23,119
all, but I I understand a lot more and I

1268
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:25,520
get a kick out of it. You know, um

1269
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:27,359
Albert Einstein supposedly on his

1270
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,079
deathbed was still trying to figure out

1271
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:32,720
problems. Um I can imagine me doing that

1272
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:36,400
because I love the problems and like to

1273
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:39,599
learn, you know. Um, so yes, I have that

1274
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,760
addiction to learning and and then uh

1275
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:44,960
one of the great things about this game

1276
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:47,359
is you bet on it and you get a score. So

1277
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,160
you you can measure my performance down

1278
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:51,920
to three decimal places and so on. Yeah.

1279
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,839
>> Has this taken a lot of time changing

1280
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,400
world order, the research, the amount of

1281
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,680
effort that

1282
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,440
>> Yes. But it's a passion,

1283
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,920
>> right? What do you hope to achieve at

1284
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,400
the other end? for me now.

1285
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,000
>> Yeah.

1286
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:07,200
>> My main thing is can I pass it along?

1287
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,839
I've got a journey and I learn and I

1288
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:12,079
love it and and all of that, but so it's

1289
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:14,960
still a passion. But what I'm really

1290
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,960
also trying to do as I approach this

1291
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,640
stage in life is to pass it along. I

1292
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,559
think there are three stages for me.

1293
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,720
There are three stages in life. There's

1294
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,800
the first stage where you're dependent

1295
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,040
on others and you're learning. You go to

1296
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,960
school, you're not really doing it.

1297
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:31,359
You're just learning right and and you

1298
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:34,400
have that dependency. Second stage is

1299
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:37,200
you begin the second phase of life very

1300
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,960
different stage is you're working and

1301
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,760
you're trying to be successful and

1302
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:44,000
others become dependent on you and in

1303
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,240
that phase you're dealing with the real

1304
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,160
world in terms of being able to do it.

1305
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:50,559
It's no longer academic

1306
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:53,520
>> and then you and you have your career

1307
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:55,520
and I started Bridgewater um largest

1308
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,920
hedge fund in the world. I started uh

1309
00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:01,040
the two-bedroom apartment. I ran it for

1310
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,960
50 years and I'm then I passed it along.

1311
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,520
Okay. Wow. What a great journey and I

1312
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:08,160
learned a lot. Okay. But now I'm at a

1313
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:11,040
phase in my life where what I want to do

1314
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:13,599
I'm in the transition to my third phase.

1315
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,400
And this in this transition I think that

1316
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:18,400
there's an instinctual

1317
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,559
uh desire to pass along what you've

1318
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,960
learned to mentor. Why am I doing your

1319
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:24,240
show? Okay. Because I have that desire.

1320
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,920
So that's what's important to me.

1321
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,640
>> And why do you have that desire? I'm

1322
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,640
just asking you.

1323
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:32,319
>> I think it's instinctual and it's

1324
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:36,319
intellectual. It's instinctual almost.

1325
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:39,359
Um we learn uh you know man's subliminal

1326
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:43,599
understanding goes back millions of

1327
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:46,240
years even though man only was 250,000

1328
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:49,760
years old and so on because of what

1329
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:52,559
becomes why do we love our raise our

1330
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:55,040
children? Why do we do many things? It's

1331
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:57,680
sub there's a lot of subliminal things

1332
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:00,400
that enter into why we do things. Uh and

1333
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:02,240
and then there's and it's intellectual.

1334
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:06,079
What do I want to do? It's the most

1335
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:08,640
valuable thing I can do. Um karma. Okay.

1336
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:11,359
Karma. What goes around comes around. In

1337
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:13,760
other words, that notion that so I I

1338
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:16,079
believe it, I feel it, and I want to do

1339
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,359
that. So, it's both intellectual and

1340
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,599
emotional.

1341
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:22,160
>> You've spoken about karma and meditation

1342
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:24,240
and

1343
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,680
Does that play a role in your investor

1344
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,839
career? It makes you a better investor.

1345
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,839
Oh,

1346
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:32,720
>> it's a it's a these are dominant things.

1347
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:36,799
Meditation has been the biggest source

1348
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:41,680
of success that I um have. It's given me

1349
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:44,000
an equinimity. It's given me um when you

1350
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,440
transcend, I do transcendal meditation

1351
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,440
this and that. When you transcend,

1352
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,200
you're going into your subconscious. And

1353
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,040
as you go into your subconscious, it

1354
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:54,559
helps align your subconscious with your

1355
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:56,799
conscious it brings back a creativity

1356
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:59,280
bring back a flow because like

1357
00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:01,760
creativity if you go take a hot shower

1358
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,079
and you you're relaxed and so on ideas

1359
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,720
can come to you not much better perhaps

1360
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:08,960
than if you try to muscle them out. So

1361
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:12,720
meditation has played an important role

1362
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,240
and then karma I I I believe in the the

1363
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:19,359
reality

1364
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:21,839
is um is that um by people mutually

1365
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:24,000
helping each other or and not just

1366
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:27,119
people but operating in a way that's

1367
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:30,079
also helpful to nature and the world

1368
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:32,559
that there is this greater um there's

1369
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:36,079
this greater good and that what happens

1370
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:38,480
is it's very functional because a little

1371
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:41,920
things that won't take much for me to

1372
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:44,960
help somebody else can make a life

1373
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,520
difference to them and then they um when

1374
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,760
they do something whether it's to me or

1375
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,839
whether others you create an environment

1376
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:55,440
like that you create a better

1377
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:58,319
environment. So not only is it practical

1378
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:01,599
it also has the effect of creating this

1379
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:04,160
wonderful uh environment. um that you

1380
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:06,720
look at um studies of history and you

1381
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:10,079
find in studies of history uh what

1382
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:13,440
brings about happiness and health past a

1383
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:15,839
certain amount of money uh of basic

1384
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,520
subsistence life there's no correlation

1385
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:20,400
between the amount of money you have and

1386
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:23,200
the amount of health happiness you have.

1387
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:26,480
Um the greatest source of uh health

1388
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:29,200
happiness excuse me across uh societies

1389
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,760
is community. if you have a good

1390
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:34,480
community and that's that's a source of

1391
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,960
helping it and well-being. So I think

1392
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:39,040
that these are laws of nature and

1393
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:41,760
they're just reality when I look at them

1394
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:44,079
that way. So yes, your your question was

1395
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,640
does meditation and karma play a role

1396
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:48,400
and it plays a role in everything. Yeah.

1397
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:51,680
>> You spoke about community ray you're

1398
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:55,200
spending time in Abu Dhabi for example.

1399
00:59:51,680 --> 01:00:00,400
U how do you find that place culturally?

1400
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:04,720
>> Oh I love it. I uh I uh I uh I started

1401
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:08,240
going there uh 32 years ago um because

1402
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:11,200
their large wealth fund uh hired me and

1403
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:14,400
I Bridgewater as an an investment. I

1404
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:17,280
think that they understand karma. Um

1405
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:20,480
each society has may call it different

1406
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:23,119
things and so on but they understand um

1407
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:27,440
the most important things and I'll and

1408
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:29,599
I'll to create a a a successful society.

1409
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,160
What it is required to to create a

1410
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:35,440
successful society is basically three

1411
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:39,839
things. If you do this well then you

1412
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:41,520
have a successful society. The first is

1413
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:45,119
teach your children, educate your

1414
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:48,160
children well so that they are capable

1415
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:51,760
of uh succeeding, earning money and so

1416
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:53,440
on and living a life and also that uh

1417
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:57,319
they're civil,

1418
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,319
>> they understand civility.

1419
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:04,880
Have them come out to a civil society in

1420
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,040
which people work well together to make

1421
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:09,680
good things happen.

1422
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:11,760
and stay out of wars. Stay out of a

1423
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:15,200
domestic war and stay out of an

1424
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:18,000
international war. If you do those three

1425
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:20,480
things, well, you will have a successful

1426
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,559
society.

1427
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:27,520
Okay. So now if when I look at the the

1428
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:29,599
places you could almost look at that is

1429
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,920
is there harmony?

1430
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:34,480
Is there do you educate the children

1431
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,480
well? And and do you have broad-based

1432
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,240
prosperity?

1433
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,559
In other words, that it works well for

1434
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,240
most people,

1435
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:45,760
right?

1436
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:49,119
These are these are fundamentals. And

1437
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:51,680
so, um, in the Gulf countries, uh,

1438
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:54,079
particularly Abu Dhabi or the UAE and

1439
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:56,559
Saudi Arabia and so on, even there's a

1440
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:58,960
bedawin culture and so on that has

1441
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:01,440
elements, uh, a lot of elements in in

1442
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:04,079
those things. It exists in other places

1443
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:06,640
in in various places.

1444
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:10,160
success is their version of it. If you

1445
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:12,000
go to um Asia and and you go to

1446
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,799
Singapore, you go to China, they do it

1447
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,599
in their confusion way. Okay, in terms

1448
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:20,799
of harmony, how do you do harmony or

1449
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:23,119
what is common prosperity? How do I um

1450
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:24,480
make it that most people are benefiting

1451
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:27,040
and that if you look at the

1452
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:29,440
accomplishments within India in terms of

1453
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:32,720
the development and and so when I say

1454
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:35,440
that civility certain basics do you earn

1455
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:37,200
more than you spend do you have a good

1456
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,119
income statement and a good balance

1457
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:42,319
sheet

1458
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:45,760
okay these are basics you have these

1459
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:47,599
basics you will have a successful not

1460
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,280
I'm not saying not challenging but

1461
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:51,520
you'll have a successful life and you

1462
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:54,000
have a successful society.

1463
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:57,200
>> You've had a very eclectic experience in

1464
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:01,599
terms of China, Russia, Abu Dhabi,

1465
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:04,799
Saudi. Uh how are they like

1466
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:07,040
how are these people to talk to or can

1467
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:13,640
you tell us something about them?

1468
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:13,640
>> Well, the best uh um the best leaders

1469
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,559
are reflective.

1470
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:26,160
They go above it.

1471
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:28,559
It being how the world evolves, where

1472
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:31,760
they are in the cycles.

1473
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:35,760
They understand human nature

1474
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:38,480
and they care deeply about uh the

1475
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:41,119
well-being of their people and they're

1476
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,640
practical

1477
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,160
that those are, you know, the

1478
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:46,799
characteristics. So we have

1479
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:49,200
conversations that are quite like this

1480
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:52,240
and then you get into this particular

1481
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:55,440
like what to do you know that you know

1482
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:58,400
how do you deal with the conflict okay

1483
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:04,240
so there's the conflict and like a a

1484
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:06,400
general rule um be neutral

1485
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:10,480
okay because if you look at the history

1486
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:13,520
of wars and so on there are

1487
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:16,720
winners of the wars losers of the wars

1488
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:19,760
and neutral country countries.

1489
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:21,920
The winners of the wars lose,

1490
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,760
meaning they still get deeper in debt

1491
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:27,280
and they have the consequences of the

1492
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:30,400
wars. The losers of the wars get wiped

1493
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:34,480
out. They lose everything. And the

1494
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:36,319
neutral countries prosper from the wars.

1495
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,640
Even that's how they accumulate money

1496
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:40,799
and they don't have that problem. And so

1497
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,960
it's it's always better to operate that

1498
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:47,039
way. Now if you look at history and you

1499
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:49,440
then say we apply it today.

1500
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:50,480
>> Okay. So the conversations are like

1501
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,559
that.

1502
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,240
>> You've liked China for many years. I

1503
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:58,480
think one of your kids went to live in

1504
01:04:54,240 --> 01:05:02,000
China. How do you see the global dynamic

1505
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:04,240
playing out between China, America,

1506
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,200
Russia, maybe you can opine on India as

1507
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,200
well.

1508
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,599
>> What do you think will happen next?

1509
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:11,520
>> Now we have the changing world order.

1510
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:14,000
the United States and other countries

1511
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:15,920
have a different mentality about

1512
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,319
fighting and so on so forth. There may

1513
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:21,440
be that dynamic. So now you have a great

1514
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:23,200
the change what power matters power in

1515
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:26,240
all of this not it's not the rules of

1516
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:28,640
the game it's not etiquette it is power

1517
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:31,520
matters and that is the dynamic that we

1518
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:34,160
have what's most important is how

1519
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:36,160
healthy the country is each country more

1520
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:39,039
important than the international if

1521
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:42,480
you're strong you're strong and that's

1522
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:44,400
the most so be strong and healthy and so

1523
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,480
there uh the United States is going

1524
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,920
through its challenges we could we

1525
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,559
talked about that. We could talk about

1526
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,640
that more. And then the and then uh

1527
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:54,559
China is going through its challenges.

1528
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,799
India is going through its challenges.

1529
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:59,200
But how it goes through those challenges

1530
01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:01,280
to do the things that I just said are

1531
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:04,079
effective to make an effective country

1532
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:06,480
is the most important thing. So I don't

1533
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:09,599
think we're going to there is a greater

1534
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:12,240
risk that we can have um I'll say

1535
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:13,920
military war. We are certainly in the

1536
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,839
classic wars that happened before a

1537
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,920
military war. We're in a trade war.

1538
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:20,640
We're in a technology war. We're in a

1539
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:22,559
geopolitical influence war. All of those

1540
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:25,039
are in that and that's the dynamic

1541
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:26,960
that's happening. If you're asking me uh

1542
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:29,599
what it means, I think that it's

1543
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:32,799
probably that they're not it's lower

1544
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:35,359
risk of, you know, a big it can happen.

1545
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:38,079
You have to be careful. But um I think

1546
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:41,280
then it's how each country takes care of

1547
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:44,480
their own and becomes strong and healthy

1548
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:47,039
that matters most. And how do you think

1549
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,960
the dynamics between them will change?

1550
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:50,559
If I were to get more specific as a

1551
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,559
proportion of world trade, who will do

1552
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:55,440
better? Will it be 10 years forward?

1553
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,160
Will it be China or the US?

1554
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,000
>> I think

1555
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,359
>> and also how does India fit into this?

1556
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,200
What can we do better?

1557
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:04,559
>> Um

1558
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:07,280
I think the technology war is the most

1559
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:11,119
important war that almost whoever wins

1560
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:14,079
the technology war will win almost

1561
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:17,280
everything. I think that right now you

1562
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:21,200
have a situation where they recognize

1563
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:24,720
that the each side can do harm to them

1564
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:26,880
and actually is using techniques and so

1565
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,799
there we're now in a period of time of

1566
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,319
inter eliminate or reduce

1567
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:32,720
interdependencies

1568
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:35,039
that there's a list that both countries

1569
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:37,680
or all countries are going on and they

1570
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:40,400
say how can I squeeze the other what

1571
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:43,119
dependency do they have that I can use

1572
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:45,920
to squeeze the other or what dependency

1573
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:49,119
do I have that might be used against me

1574
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:51,680
to create squeezes and that's in capital

1575
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:54,240
as well as trade and so on. So

1576
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:57,200
everybody's now going to kind of this

1577
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:59,680
independence and you know minimizing

1578
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:02,000
interdependence because that's the smart

1579
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:04,640
thing to do whatever because I will be

1580
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,119
squeezed if I can be it'll be used

1581
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:10,240
against me. So that's where we are on

1582
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:12,720
that and then compete to become most

1583
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:14,640
effective most powerful most rich most

1584
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:17,759
powerful they're both doing that and

1585
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:20,239
technology will be important. So I think

1586
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:24,719
that over those periods of time you're

1587
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:27,679
going to see um that dynamic. Um I think

1588
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:30,640
China um they're ahead and behind in

1589
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:33,440
different ways. Um for example, the

1590
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:36,640
inventiveness of new chips um and the

1591
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:39,920
most advanced chips. Um the United

1592
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:43,520
States is a bit ahead is is ahead. Um

1593
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:46,719
and then uh but the application to use

1594
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:49,199
the chips whatever AI there is to be

1595
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:52,080
able to integrate it into life and

1596
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:54,640
making it for the society most

1597
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:59,520
applications and most effect China's

1598
01:08:54,640 --> 01:09:01,040
ahead. I think that um India is um at a

1599
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:06,400
wonderful

1600
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:09,359
um arc in terms of um its circumstances,

1601
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:12,319
its potential and and what and what it's

1602
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:15,520
developing. And I think that um uh

1603
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:19,520
President Modi is very much like uh Deng

1604
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:23,759
Xiaoping for China. Um and what I mean

1605
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:26,719
by that is that um he's creating changes

1606
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:29,120
and when you are have a country that um

1607
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:31,839
can build its infrastructure and can

1608
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:34,640
build on that so that you and you don't

1609
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:38,960
have much debt and you have a large

1610
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:42,960
talented population in many ways um that

1611
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:45,440
um um for these reasons I have um I've

1612
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,839
created a u indicators leading

1613
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:50,960
indicators of what countries ries have

1614
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:53,600
their ingredients to project the next 10

1615
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:56,000
years growth rate. India is best India

1616
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:58,239
is going to have probably the has the

1617
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,560
best fundamentals to have the best

1618
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:03,440
growth rate in that because you're going

1619
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:05,440
from not having enough money to having

1620
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:07,120
that has infrastructure. You have to

1621
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,800
build infrastructure. When you're

1622
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,560
building infrastructure, when you're

1623
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,679
creating this the things that are

1624
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:15,520
happening in in the not only um all the

1625
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:17,600
different infrastructure including the

1626
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:20,960
ability to get credit and the ability to

1627
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:22,880
do transactions and so on um in that

1628
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,560
that produces a growth curve

1629
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:28,159
particularly if you don't have very much

1630
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:30,880
debt um and you have talented people. So

1631
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:32,719
I for those reasons I think India over

1632
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,679
the next 10 years has all the

1633
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:37,920
ingredients to really be the strongest

1634
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:40,640
growth rate and and improvement.

1635
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:44,320
However, it's it still has development

1636
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:48,080
to do. It is more akin to where China

1637
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:51,199
was um you know uh 30 years ago maybe

1638
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:54,239
than where um China is today. So it has

1639
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:57,120
that that growth. it the actual power of

1640
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:58,320
it is not as great as the uh those other

1641
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,760
two countries.

1642
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:02,960
>> Ry, I'm going to ask you the last

1643
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:07,120
question of today. If you were 25 years

1644
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:08,719
old and in India and you had either $100

1645
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,960
to

1646
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:13,840
if you had $100 to invest somewhere,

1647
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:16,320
where would you put the money? The first

1648
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:20,880
thing I would do

1649
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:25,520
um is ask myself what do I need most to

1650
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:27,920
be most successful and I would secure

1651
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:30,640
that right it's not just return on

1652
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:33,679
investment does that mean that I can

1653
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:36,159
take a little bit of that $100 and I

1654
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:40,320
could start my little business or do I

1655
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:43,360
secure that $100 to have my education

1656
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:46,560
that I'm being able to operate whatever

1657
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:50,560
is going to as a young person invest in

1658
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:53,040
their own success to be able to learn.

1659
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:55,840
Do I how do I learn? Do I listen to your

1660
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:59,520
podcast? What is it that is going to

1661
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:02,080
allow me as that young person to be able

1662
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:04,320
to invest in myself and learn and get

1663
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:06,159
better? So, that's the most important

1664
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,600
thing. That's the best investment I can

1665
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:10,560
make.

1666
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:13,360
>> Super. Any last words for our audience?

1667
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:17,280
>> No, just thank you. Um I would say if

1668
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:22,560
you are interested in staying in touch

1669
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:25,760

1670
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:28,560

01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:30,800

1672
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,480
them to be able to communicate this way

1673
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,239
and I hope it's of some use.

1674
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,880
>> Thank you. I hope you come visit India

1675
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,159
someday soon.

1676
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:39,785
