1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
I feel like only 30 to 40% of what I've

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,879
learned in the last 15 to 20 years of

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,800
being in growth transfers here because

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,519
we just need to invest in such bigger

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,400
bets and innovate and create new growth

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,720
loops here. I usually spend maybe 5%

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,880
maybe 10% if I'm lucky innovating on

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,920
growth in my previous roles. Right now

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,800
I'm spending 95% innovating on growth

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,119
and only 5% on optimization. Here what I

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,119
find is that optimizations are just not

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,840
worth our time. And the market is moving

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,920
so quickly, you need to stand up a bunch

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,160
of initiatives to capture it because

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,719
it's perishable. We also have so much

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,879
competition. We're not alone here. So,

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,879
we can't ignore that. Everybody and

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,559
their mother is starting a VIP coding

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,399
business nowadays. We need to figure out

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,320
how to be ahead of them. And to be ahead

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,079
of them is not optimization of the

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,079
problem. It's reinvention of the

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,079
solution.
