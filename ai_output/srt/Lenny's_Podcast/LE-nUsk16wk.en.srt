00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,640
We recently shipped the Sora Android app

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,200
like a fully new app. We built it in 18

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,679
days. It went from zero to launch to

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,360
employees and then 10 days later so 28

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,719
days total we went to the public and

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,440
that was done just with the help of

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,440
Codex. The speed and ambition of working

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,880
at OpenAI are just dramatically more

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,920
than what I can imagine. You know I

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,359
guess it's kind of an embarrassing thing

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,880
to say because you know everyone who's a

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,720
startup founder thinks like oh yeah my

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,160
startup moves super fast and the talent

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,160
bar is super high and we're super

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,000
ambitious. But I have to say, working at

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,240
OpenAI just made me reimagine what that

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,240
even means.
