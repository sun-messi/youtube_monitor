1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,359
One of our biggest strategy is building

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,839
in public and it's coupled with employee

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,679
socials, founder le socials for sure.

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,160
What's really important to us is to

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,240
maintain noise in the market and that

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,960
noise in the market happens by us

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,119
shipping every day, every other day,

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,880
multiple times per day and just talking

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,800
about it constantly. Interestingly

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,560
enough, it's actually works as fantastic

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,240
resurrection strategy because people

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,680
like, "Oh, there's more things here.

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,199
Like, I need to go check it out." It

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,640
also works as great re-engagement

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,320
strategy. So instead of sending

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,000
newsletters to say like here's the

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,440
market trends or here's the user stories

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,520
like people are like literally logging

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,559
into their social to see like okay what

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,559
has lovable shipped now.
