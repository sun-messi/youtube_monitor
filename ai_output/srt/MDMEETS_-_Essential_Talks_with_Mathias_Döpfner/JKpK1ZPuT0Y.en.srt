1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,000
the symbol of the disco era uh Studio 54

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:10,719
was not particularly about politics. Uh

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,880
and there is this famous uh story that

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,120
you didn't get in. Recently I had a

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,080
podcast with Barry Dilla the Hollywood

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,000
mogul I know

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,039
>> who had a very similar experience. She

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,720
also wanted to go to 54, didn't get in.

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,199
And she described it in a way as a

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:30,560
motivator for for him to to get I don't

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,559
know, not only to get in, but to get

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,200
even better and show it to the rest of

13
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:40,879
the world. So your story uh led to uh

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,399
Lefrey, the most famous cheek.

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:48,480
>> Can you share that story with us?

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:50,480
>> Yeah. So it was um so we had uh the very

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,199
first song that I wrote, Everybody

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:58,719
Dance, was really the hip underground

19
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,359
chic record. Yes. Dance, dance, dance ya

20
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,320
was on the radio getting a lot of play.

21
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,400
Like you said, they played dance dance

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,880
the floor. Dance floor gets packed. But

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,320
but what everybody dance was the the

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,119
symbol of chic coolness. That bass

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,400
playing that Bernard laid on that was

26
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,240
just unbelievable. And that song was

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,560
actually well known in the underground

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,400
for about a year before we got a record

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,400
deal. So, Grace Jones had heard

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,600
Everybody Dance, and that was like

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,520
really an important song to her, and she

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:39,200
called us and asked us to uh come and

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,920
see her um because she was thinking

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,400
about having us be her then record

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,079
producers, you know, like in it would

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,079
be, you know, 1977

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:57,840
or something like that. Um Yeah. And

38
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,240
we couldn't believe it because we we had

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,560
never done anything with a star even

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,280
though all of our singles were hitting.

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,759
Every every single we put out bang bang

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,760
bang everything was in the top five

43
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:14,720
every song. So uh by that time we had

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,160
already had two chic singles that were

45
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,920
big. We had our first lead singer, Norma

46
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,680
Jean. Her record uh called Saturday was

47
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,080
big and we had done Sister Sledge. So we

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,239
had He's the Greatest Dancer and Now We

49
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,400
Are Family. And um even though we

50
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:39,280
recorded that album, at the same time we

51
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,280
recorded Chic's second album, uh we had

52
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,040
decided to give the song He's the

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,959
Greatest Dancer to Sister Sledge, which

54
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,720
we wrote for ourselves.

55
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:52,080
But when we went to Studio 54 that

56
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,040
particular night, now this is the true

57
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,440
story. That wasn't the first time we'd

58
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,760
ever tried to go to Studio 54. My

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,879
girlfriend

60
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,800
>> Did you get in before?

61
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,959
>> Oh, yeah. Many times. But I always had

62
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,080
to be with my girlfriend. She used to

63
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,080
work at a store called Fioruchi. And so

64
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,640
all the people in Fuchi were totally

65
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,480
cool and every you know, they all looked

66
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,800
stylish and fashionable. So when I was

67
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,840
with my girlfriend, I could get in. But

68
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,879
that's

69
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,760
>> Fiori.

70
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,200
>> Pardon me.

71
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,280
>> Exactly. Gucci Fiori.

72
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,519
>> You know that that's the very first time

73
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,480
anybody ever name checked fashion

74
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,319
designers on a record. And now I mean we

75
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,040
created a formula which we didn't even

76
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,120
realize that we were creating. Uh now

77
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,200
you can't buy a pop record without them

78
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,519
namechecking something. Um because it

79
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,680
sort of describes the person's

80
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,599
lifestyle. you know, you say you roll,

81
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,239
you were Lamborghini rolling or

82
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,480
whatever. So anyway, what happened was

83
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,200
that night we were really going to do

84
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,680
business. So the other times that I had

85
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,680
been to Studio 54 with my girlfriend, I

86
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,200
was going there to party and the

87
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,400
business that I was doing was just

88
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,159
taking what they played at Studio 54

89
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,200
compared to what they played at the

90
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,640
underground clubs. So now we were going

91
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:13,040
to do business. So we dressed like

92
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,599
gentlemen, so to speak, and we did what

93
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,799
Grace Jones had told us. So she cold

94
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,120
called us cuz we didn't really have any

95
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,280
managers. It was just chic organization.

96
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,240
And somehow she was able to use her

97
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,840
connections to find us. She called us

98
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:33,600
and she spoke in a way that seemed a

99
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,400
little odd to us. She says, "So darling,

100
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,240
I want you to come to the back door and

101
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,919
tell them that your personal friends are

102
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,919
misgr."

103
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,280
And to us, it sounded like a cross

104
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,919
between Bella Losce, Marlene Dietrich,

105
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,600
and Bob Marley. We didn't know, we

106
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,440
didn't know that that actually was her

107
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,600
speaking voice cuz, but we knew the

108
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,440
record's tired to get down on you. You

109
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,759
know, she had that kind of nasal thing

110
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,120
going on. you know, roll up to the

111
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,280
bumper, baby, with your long back limo,

112
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,720
you know, so we thought Grace Jones

113
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,280
would be speaking like that, but instead

114
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,840
she had this sort of continental accent

115
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,520
and it was odd. And we thought that

116
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,160
that's what we were supposed to do, that

117
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,479
we were supposed to imitate that very um

118
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,240
very

119
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,560
sort of distinguish sounding thing. And

120
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,320
you know we were she so we go to the

121
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,199
back door and we go hello we are

122
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,320
personal friends of m Jones the guy

123
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,720
looks at us and he slams the door in our

124
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,759
faces and but but when he was doing it

125
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,440
anyway he goes oh [ __ ] off we no no no

126
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,240
we kicking the door saying no this is

127
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:49,120
the truth we cuz this was New Year's Eve

128
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:52,400
right 1977 going into 78 like Studio 54

129
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,160
was the hottest place on the planet

130
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,759
everybody was trying to get into Studio

131
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,960
54 on New Year's Eve. So, we kicked the

132
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,720
door a lot because we had to be louder

133
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,960
than the music inside and to get this

134
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,680
guy's attention. And he came back and he

135
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,720
said, "Didn't I tell you to [ __ ] off?"

136
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:17,199
Well, Studio 54 was one block away from

137
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:19,440
my apartment at that time. Um, so we

138
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,039
walked to my apartment, but before we

139
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,360
got to our my apartment, uh, which is

140
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,800
where our instruments were, and you know

141
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,639
where Bernard and I would write all the

142
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,560
songs cuz we had recording studio that

143
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,759
we worked at right on the ground floor,

144
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,080
but I lived on the top floor. Um, we had

145
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,280
to pass a liquor store. We bought two

146
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,680
bottles of of Don Peron champagne, what

147
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,120
we used to call rock and roll mouthwash.

148
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,120
And we we down them like one swig

149
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,440
because we were pretty pretty upset

150
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,160
because we had our shoes. I was wearing

151
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,720
suede shoes that cost a fortune that

152
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,800
were now ruined because it was snowing

153
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,080
and they put you know they put salt out

154
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:05,520
and the snow the salt had

155
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:08,000
had penetrated my suede shoes. So, so

156
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,360
this night we couldn't think of anything

157
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
except for [ __ ] off. Oh, [ __ ] off. So,

158
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,680
we went to my apartment. I picked up my

159
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,560
guitar and started playing a little

160
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,560
riff. Um,

161
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:29,599
now if you notice that most chic songs,

162
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:33,039
um, and this is before the time, this is

163
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:37,360
before like the current market where

164
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:39,199
where music sort of, um, like in our

165
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,759
current world now, music is basically

166
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:46,319
loops, two bar loops, sometimes four bar

167
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:50,080
loops. And for some strange reason

168
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,800
reason, my compositions were these sort

169
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,280
of loop based compositions. Like it's

170
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,360
not that we were loops, but we were

171
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:02,879
actually playing. And so the choruses

172
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,919
and the verses are harmonically pretty

173
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,400
much the same. I'll just sometimes do a

174
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,360
different inversion or we'll dynamically

175
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,199
change it, but it's pretty much the same

176
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:18,160
thing. It's just a a revoicing of the

177
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,360
chorus, so to speak. So, we went back to

178
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,199
the apartment and I started playing a

179
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,759
[ __ ] off.

180
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,759
Don't [ __ ] studio 54. [ __ ] off.

181
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,280
[ __ ] off. and Bernard started going

182
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,959
and we singing and we wrote a whole song

183
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:47,040
where the uh we did verses and middle

184
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,519
and the whole bit and we wrote a song

185
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,160
where the most appropriate response

186
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,839
would be [ __ ] off. So we would say like

187
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,320
if a cab driver cuts you off, [ __ ] off

188
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,160
if your mom asks you to do homework,

189
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,480
[ __ ] off. It was great and we were

190
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:07,279
laughing. We were totally entertained.

191
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,360
And Bernard said, "Uh, my man, cuz he we

192
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,000
always wore dark glasses." Said, "My

193
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,399
man, you know this [ __ ] is happening." I

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,240
was like, "Bernard, this is like two

195
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,040
years before hip-hop. We like we're not

196
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,360
going to get [ __ ] off on the radio." But

197
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,279
I was I grew up as a hippie. Like my

198
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,839
parents would beat Nicks. I was a

199
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:31,760
hippie. Um, so I said to him and like my

200
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,519
whole demeanor changed. I went from

201
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:39,760
being like the cool club kid in the nice

202
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:42,160
suit to like, oh man, like you know, you

203
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,000
know, when you drop acid, man, cuz now

204
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,320
you were saying, "Oh, [ __ ] off." And we

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,360
knew a good euphemism for [ __ ] in

206
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,920
America is free. Oh, you freaking nuts.

207
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,800
You freaking maniac. Oh, freak. Get the

208
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,200
freak out of here. Um, so I said, "Oh,

209
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,680
man. You know, like when you drop acid

210
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,839
and you have a bad trip, uh, it's like

211
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,200
freaking out, man." And Bernard was

212
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,040
like, "He came from a completely

213
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,279
different background." And he looked at

214
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,760
me like I was crazy. And so right away,

215
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,519
I got my black union card back. I said,

216
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,360
"Well, you know, like if you see a fine

217
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,519
girl and you go out on the dance floor

218
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,880
and you just start freaking out," and he

219
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,920
says, "Oh, man." And it's like that new

220
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,800
dance my kids are doing. What new dance

221
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,720
her kids are doing? The Freak. Really?

222
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,279
Oh, wow. There's a dance called The

223
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:34,320
Freak. Yeah. So, we ran out to the

224
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:38,079
record store and we got the uh what we

225
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,320
thought would be the uh I guess the

226
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,920
template for a great record about a

227
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,519
dance.

228
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,000
Chubby Checker, the Twist. Like, what's

229
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,200
more iconic than that? like maybe one of

230
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,920
the biggest songs about a specific dance

231
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,000
ever. So we buy that and then we buy

232
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,480
Joey D and the Starlighter song called

233
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,920
The Peppermint Twist and we listen to

234
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,760
the record and Chubby Checker goes,

235
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:10,240
"Come on baby, let's do the twist. Come

236
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,399
on baby, let's do the twist. Take me by

237
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,399
the middle

238
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,760
bop and go like this."

239
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,000
We're like waiting for him to tell us

240
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,000
how to do the twist and we realize he

241
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,399
doesn't tell us. Joey D and the

242
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,800
Starlighters. Well, we got a new dance

243
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,880
and it goes like this.

244
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,440
Well, the name of this dance is the

245
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,440
peppermint twist.

246
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,600
The peppermint twist. Oh, all right. All

247
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,680
right. They don't say how to do them

248
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,160
peppermint twist. We go, what the hell?

249
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,839
We don't know how to do the freak. So,

250
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,440
we just say, "Have you heard about the

251
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,839
new dance craze list now? I'm sure

252
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,079
you'll be amazed. Big fun to be had by

253
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,920
everyone. It's up to you. Surely can be

254
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,640
done. Young and old are doing this, I'm

255
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,640
told. Just one try and you two will be

256
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,040
sold. It's called the freak. They're

257
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,720
doing it night and day. Allow us. We'll

258
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,920
show you the way." And of course, we

259
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,399
can't show you the way cuz we don't know

260
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,920
how to do it. So, we just go, "Ah, freak

261
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,880
out.

262
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,360
A [ __ ] off. A freak out." Unbelievable

263
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,440
story.

264
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,600
>> Biggest selling record in the history of

265
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,800
Atlante. Now we're talking the record

266
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,600
that has um everybody from Ray Charles,

267
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,600
Artha Franklin to

268
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,920
Cream, the Rolling Stones, biggest

269
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,839
record. Um uh Crosby, Stills and Nash,

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,000
um I mean just all these huge

271
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:37,600
superstars. But the biggest selling

272
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,240
single of all times is a freak out of a

273
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:44,279
frustration after you didn't get inu to

274
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,279
studio. Wonderful.
